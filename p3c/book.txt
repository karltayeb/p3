PREFACE
The
plan
of
the
Third
Reader
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
Second
with
the
exception
that
a
few
historical
lessons
have
been
introduced
and
two
lessons
which
may
serve
as
an
introduction
to
Physical
Science
The
botanical
lessons
supplement
those
given
in
the
Second
Reader
These
and
the
lessons
on
Canadian
trees
and
all
lessons
relating
to
things
in
nature
should
be
made
the
subjects
of
conversation
between
the
teacher
and
his
class
and
should
form
a
basis
for
scientific
instruction
The
pupils
should
be
led
to
study
nature
directly
To
this
end
they
should
be
required
to
obtain
wherever
possible
the
natural
objects
which
are
described
in
the
lessons
and
to
examine
them
and
to
form
opinions
for
themselves
concerning
them
Similarly
every
lesson
should
form
the
subject
of
conversation
before
reading
during
the
progress
of
the
reading
and
after
reading
the
teacher
eliciting
from
his
pupils
clear
statements
of
their
knowledge
of
it
correcting
any
wrong
notions
they
may
have
of
it
throwing
them
back
upon
their
own
experience
or
reading
and
leading
them
to
observe
compare
and
judge
and
to
state
in
words
the
results
of
their
observations
comparisons
and
judgments
Some
of
these
statements
should
be
written
on
the
blackboard
and
then
be
made
the
subject
of
critical
conversation
others
might
be
written
by
the
pupils
at
their
desks
and
afterwards
be
reviewed
in
class
In
this
incidental
teaching
it
should
be
the
teacher
s
aim
to
develop
the
previous
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
pupils
concerning
a
lesson
into
a
full
and
complete
knowledge
This
can
best
be
effected
by
judicious
questioning
and
conversation
The
illustrations
of
the
lessons
as
in
the
Second
Reader
are
intended
to
aid
the
pupils
in
obtaining
real
conceptions
of
the
ideas
involved
in
the
lessons
Children
vary
greatly
in
capacity
for
imagination
It
is
essential
however
to
the
proper
understanding
of
a
lesson
and
hence
to
the
proper
reading
of
it
that
a
child
be
able
to
imagine
the
persons
actions
objects
described
in
it
The
illustrations
will
aid
in
developing
this
power
of
imagination
and
the
teacher
by
his
questions
and
appropriate
criticisms
and
by
a
judicious
use
of
his
own
greater
knowledge
and
experience
will
aid
still
more
in
developing
it
In
the
poetry
great
care
has
been
taken
to
select
not
only
such
pieces
as
children
can
easily
comprehend
but
also
such
as
are
in
themselves
good
literature
Many
old
favorites
have
been
retained
their
worth
as
reading
lessons
having
been
proved
with
generations
of
school
children
In
the
reading
of
poetry
the
teacher
must
constantly
assure
himself
that
the
pupils
clearly
understand
what
they
read
Children
have
a
natural
ear
for
rhythm
and
a
fondness
for
rhyme
Hence
they
easily
learn
to
read
verse
being
insensibly
charmed
by
its
melody
But
they
cannot
with
equal
facility
comprehend
the
poetical
meanings
the
terse
expressions
and
the
inverted
constructions
with
which
verse
abounds
Much
more
time
therefore
should
be
spent
by
the
teacher
in
poetry
than
in
prose
in
eliciting
from
his
pupils
the
meanings
of
words
phrases
and
sentences
He
should
not
rest
satisfied
until
the
pupils
can
substitute
for
every
more
important
word
phrase
and
sentence
of
a
poem
an
equivalent
of
their
own
finding
He
must
be
certain
too
that
they
understand
the
substitutions
which
they
offer
Conversation
and
questioning
will
here
as
elsewhere
in
school
work
help
him
in
effecting
his
purpose
The
exercises
which
are
put
at
the
end
of
some
of
the
lessons
are
intended
merely
as
examples
of
exercises
which
the
teacher
can
himself
prepare
for
all
the
lessons
Methods
of
using
these
have
been
described
in
the
Preface
to
the
Second
Reader
In
the
Word
Exercises
many
of
the
words
have
been
re
spelled
phonetically
to
indicate
their
pronunciation
This
too
is
merely
an
example
of
what
may
be
done
with
all
words
Pupils
should
be
taught
to
pick
out
the
silent
letters
in
words
and
to
indicate
the
true
phonetic
equivalents
of
the
orthographical
expedients
as
they
are
called
by
which
vowel
sounds
are
often
indicated
For
example
in
neighbour
g
h
and
either
o
or
u
are
silent
and
ei
does
duty
for
so
that
the
pronunciation
of
the
word
may
be
indicated
by
n
bor
or
n
bur
It
will
be
a
useful
exercise
for
the
pupils
sometimes
to
write
out
in
this
way
on
the
blackboard
the
phonetic
spelling
of
the
irregularly
spelled
words
which
occur
in
their
lessons
alongside
of
their
common
spelling
Practice
will
soon
give
facility
in
doing
this
It
is
believed
that
by
such
practice
the
orthography
of
irregularly
spelled
words
will
be
more
easily
remembered
and
accuracy
of
pronunciation
more
readily
gained
To
aid
in
securing
accuracy
of
pronunciation
a
short
chapter
on
Ortho
py
has
been
prefixed
to
the
reading
lessons
The
statements
in
it
are
to
form
a
basis
for
lessons
to
be
given
by
the
teacher
to
the
pupils
in
conversation
Ortho
py
is
acquired
only
by
constant
attention
to
utterance
Carefulness
in
enunciation
must
first
become
a
habit
The
correct
pronunciation
of
individual
words
will
then
be
gained
by
the
imitation
of
those
who
speak
correctly
or
reference
to
a
dictionary
It
is
true
that
in
the
pronunciation
of
many
words
authorities
differ
widely
hence
dogmatism
in
pronunciation
is
to
be
avoided
Notwithstanding
this
no
one
can
hope
to
become
a
correct
speaker
without
the
careful
study
of
a
dictionary
The
teacher
should
see
that
the
system
of
sound
marking
adopted
by
the
dictionary
in
use
in
his
school
is
understood
by
his
pupils
so
that
they
may
consult
it
intelligently

ORTHO
PY
Ortho
py
or
Correct
Pronunciation
is
the
utterance
of
words
with
their
right
sounds
and
accents
as
sanctioned
by
the
best
usage
It
depends
principally
upon
Articulation
Syllabication
and
Accentuation
Articulation
is
the
distinct
utterance
of
the
elementary
vowel
and
consonant
sounds
of
the
language
whether
separate
or
combined
into
syllables
and
words
In
pronouncing
a
word
its
elementary
sounds
should
be
correctly
articulated
The
more
common
faults
in
articulation
are
Omitting
a
vowel
sound
or
substituting
one
vowel
sound
for
another
in
an
unaccented
syllable
Of
all
faults
in
pronunciation
probably
this
is
the
commonest
As
a
rule
it
results
from
carelessness
in
utterance
Examples
of
it
are

Substituting
one
vowel
sound
for
another
in
an
accented
syllable
or
a
one

word
This
fault
may
result
not
from
carelessness
but
from
want
of
knowledge
for
the
correct
pronunciation
of
the
vowel
sounds
of
words
must
be
learned
from
some
correct
speaker
or
from
a

Syllabication
in
Ortho
py
is
the
correct
formation
of
syllables
in
pronouncing
words
A
syllable
is
a
sound
or
a
combination
of
sounds
uttered
by
a
single
impulse
of
the
voice
and
constituting
a
word
or
a
part
of
a
word
A
word
has
as
many
syllables
as
it
has
separate
vowel
sounds
When
words
are
uttered
so
that
their
vowel
sounds
are
clearly
and
correctly
articulated
they
will
be
properly
syllabified
Accentuation
is
the
correct
placing
of
accent
in
uttering
words
Accent
is
a
superior
stress
or
force
of
voice
upon
certain
syllables
of
words
which
distinguishes
them
from
the
other
syllables
In
uttering
a
word
of
more
than
one
syllable
one
of
the
syllables
receives
a
greater
stress
in
pronunciation
than
the
others
and
is
said
to
be
accented
or
to
have
the
accent
Some
words
have
more
than
one
syllable
accented
as
con
fla
gra
tion
in
com
pre
hen
si
bil
ity
but
one
syllable
is
always
more
strongly
accented
than
the
others
and
is
said
to
have
the
main
or
primary
accent
Accentuation
like
the
other

by
the

those

In

I
THE
WHITE
SHIP
CHARLES
DICKENS
King
Henry
I
went
over
to
Normandy
with
his
son
Prince
William
and
a
great
retinue
to
have
the
prince
acknowledged
as
his
successor
and
to
contract
a
marriage
between
him
and
the
daughter
of
the
Count
of
Anjou
Both
these
things
were
triumphantly
done
with
great
show
and
rejoicing
and
on
the
th
of
November
in
the
year
the
whole
retinue
prepared
to
embark
for
the
voyage
home
On
that
day
there
came
to
the
king
Fitz
Stephen
a
sea
captain
and
said
My
liege
my
father
served
your
father
all
his
life
upon
the
sea
He
steered
the
ship
with
the
golden
boy
upon
the
prow
in
which
your
father
sailed
to
conquer
England
I
have
a
fair
vessel
in
the
harbor
here
called
The
White
Ship
manned
by
fifty
sailors
of
renown
I
pray
you
Sire
to
let
your
servant
have
the
honor
of
steering
you
in
The
White
Ship
to
England
I
am
sorry
friend
replied
the
king
that
my
ship
is
already
chosen
and
that
I
cannot
therefore
sail
with
the
son
of
the
man
who
served
my
father
But
the
prince
and
his
company
shall
go
along
with
you
in
the
fair
White
Ship
manned
by
the
fifty
sailors
of
renown
An
hour
or
two
afterward
the
king
set
sail
in
the
vessel
he
had
chosen
accompanied
by
other
vessels
and
sailing
all
night
with
a
fair
and
gentle
wind
arrived
upon
the
coast
of
England
in
the
morning
While
it
was
yet
night
the
people
in
some
of
these
ships
heard
a
faint
wild
cry
come
over
the
sea
and
wondered
what
it
was
Illustration
Now
the
prince
was
a
dissolute
young
man
of
eighteen
who
bore
no
love
to
the
English
and
who
had
declared
that
when
he
came
to
the
throne
he
would
yoke
them
to
the
plough
like
oxen
He
went
aboard
The
White
Ship
with
one
hundred
and
forty
youthful
nobles
like
himself
among
whom
were
eighteen
noble
ladies
of
the
highest
rank
All
this
gay
company
with
their
servants
and
the
fifty
sailors
made
three
hundred
souls
aboard
the
fair
White
Ship
Give
three
casks
of
wine
Fitz
Stephen
said
the
prince
to
the
fifty
sailors
of
renown
My
father
the
king
has
sailed
out
of
the
harbor
What
time
is
there
to
make
merry
here
and
yet
reach
England
with
the
rest
Prince
said
Fitz
Stephen
before
morning
my
fifty
and
The
White
Ship
shall
overtake
the
swiftest
vessel
in
attendance
on
your
father
the
king
if
we
sail
at
midnight
Then
the
prince
commanded
to
make
merry
and
the
sailors
drank
out
the
three
casks
of
wine
and
the
prince
and
all
the
noble
company
danced
in
the
moonlight
on
the
deck
of
The
White
Ship
When
at
last
she
shot
out
of
the
harbor
there
was
not
a
sober
seaman
on
board
But
the
sails
were
all
set
and
the
oars
all
going
merrily
Fitz
Stephen
had
the
helm
The
gay
young
nobles
and
the
beautiful
ladies
wrapped
in
mantles
of
various
bright
colors
to
protect
them
from
the
cold
talked
laughed
and
sang
The
prince
encouraged
the
fifty
sailors
to
row
yet
harder
for
the
honor
of
The
White
Ship
Crash
A
terrific
cry
broke
from
three
hundred
hearts
It
was
the
cry
the
people
in
the
distant
vessels
of
the
king
heard
faintly
on
the
water
The
White
Ship
had
struck
upon
a
rock
was
filling
going
down
Fitz
Stephen
hurried
the
prince
into
a
boat
with
some
few
nobles
Push
off
he
whispered
and
row
to
the
land
It
is
not
far
and
the
sea
is
smooth
The
rest
of
us
must
die
But
as
they
rowed
fast
away
from
the
sinking
ship
the
prince
heard
the
voice
of
his
sister
calling
for
help
He
never
in
his
life
had
been
so
good
as
he
was
then
He
cried
in
agony
Row
back
at
any
risk
I
cannot
bear
to
leave
her
They
rowed
back
As
the
prince
held
out
his
arm
to
catch
his
sister
such
numbers
leaped
into
the
boat
that
it
was
overset
And
in
the
same
instant
The
White
Ship
went
down
Only
two
men
floated
They
both
clung
to
the
mainyard
of
the
ship
which
had
broken
from
the
mast
and
now
supported
them
One
asked
the
other
who
he
was
He
replied
I
am
a
nobleman
Godfrey
by
name
son
of
Gilbert
And
you
I
am
a
poor
butcher
of
Rouen
was
the
answer
Then
they
said
together
Lord
be
merciful
to
us
both
and
tried
to
encourage
each
other
as
they
drifted
in
the
cold
benumbing
sea
on
that
unfortunate
November
night
By
and
by
another
man
came
swimming
toward
them
whom
they
knew
when
he
pushed
aside
his
long
wet
hair
to
be
Fitz
Stephen
Where
is
the
prince
said
he
Gone
gone
the
two
cried
together
Neither
he
nor
his
brother
nor
his
sister
nor
the
king
s
niece
nor
her
brother
nor
any
one
of
all
the
brave
three
hundred
noble
or
commoner
except
us
three
has
risen
above
the
water
Fitz
Stephen
with
a
ghastly
face
cried
Woe
woe
to
me
and
sank
to
the
bottom
The
other
two
clung
to
the
yard
for
some
hours
At
length
the
young
noble
said
faintly
I
am
exhausted
and
chilled
with
the
cold
and
can
hold
no
longer
Farewell
good
friend
God
preserve
you
So
he
dropped
and
sank
and
of
all
the
brilliant
crowd
the
poor
butcher
of
Rouen
alone
was
saved
In
the
morning
some
fishermen
saw
him
floating
in
his
sheep
skin
coat
and
got
him
into
their
boat
the
sole
relator
of
the
dismal
tale
For
three
days
no
one
dared
to
carry
the
intelligence
to
the
king
At
length
they
sent
into
his
presence
a
little
boy
who
weeping
bitterly
and
falling
at
his
feet
told
him
that
The
White
Ship
was
lost
with
all
on
board
The
king
fell
to
the
ground
like
a
dead
man
and
never
never
afterward
was
seen
to
smile

THE
GIRAFFE
OR
CAMELOPARD
There
are
few
sights
more
pleasing
than
a
herd
of
tall
graceful
giraffes
With
their
heads
reaching
a
height
of
from
twelve
to
eighteen
feet
they
move
about
in
small
herds
on
the
open
plains
of
Africa
eating
the
tender
twigs
and
leaves
of
the
mimosa
and
other
trees
Illustration
The
legs
of
a
large
giraffe
are
about
nine
feet
long
and
its
neck
nearly
six
feet
while
its
body
measures
only
seven
feet
in
length
and
slopes
rapidly
from
the
neck
to
the
tail
The
graceful
appearance
of
the
giraffe
is
increased
by
the
beauty
of
its
skin
which
is
orange
red
in
color
and
mottled
with
dark
spots
Its
long
tail
has
at
the
end
a
tuft
of
thick
hair
which
serves
the
purpose
of
keeping
off
the
flies
and
stinging
insects
so
plentiful
in
the
hot
climate
of
Africa
Its
tongue
is
very
wonderful
It
is
from
thirteen
to
seventeen
inches
in
length
is
slender
and
pointed
and
is
capable
of
being
moved
in
so
many
ways
that
it
is
almost
as
useful
to
the
giraffe
as
the
trunk
is
to
the
elephant
The
horns
of
the
giraffe
are
very
short
and
covered
with
skin
At
the
ends
there
are
tufts
of
short
hair
The
animal
has
divided
hoofs
somewhat
resembling
those
of
the
ox
The
head
of
the
giraffe
is
small
and
its
eyes
large
and
mild
looking
These
eyes
are
set
in
such
a
way
that
the
animal
can
see
a
great
deal
of
what
is
behind
it
without
turning
its
head
In
addition
to
its
wonderful
power
of
sight
the
giraffe
can
scent
danger
from
a
great
distance
so
that
there
is
no
animal
more
difficult
of
approach
Strange
to
relate
the
giraffe
has
no
voice
In
London
some
years
ago
two
giraffes
were
burned
to
death
in
their
stables
when
the
slightest
sound
would
have
given
notice
of
their
danger
and
have
saved
their
lives
The
giraffe
is
naturally
both
gentle
and
timid
and
he
will
always
try
to
avoid
danger
by
flight
It
is
when
running
that
he
exposes
his
only
ungraceful
point
He
runs
swiftly
but
since
he
moves
his
fore
and
hind
legs
on
each
side
at
the
same
time
the
movement
gives
him
a
very
awkward
gait
But
though
timid
he
will
when
overtaken
turn
even
upon
the
lion
or
panther
and
defend
himself
successfully
by
powerful
kicks
with
his
strong
legs
The
natives
of
Africa
capture
the
giraffe
in
pitfalls
which
are
deep
holes
covered
over
with
branches
of
trees
and
dirt
When
captured
the
giraffe
can
be
tamed
and
during
its
captivity
it
gives
scarcely
any
trouble
Fifty
years
ago
but
little
was
known
about
the
giraffe
in
America
or
Europe
Now
it
is
to
be
found
in
menageries
and
the
public
gardens
of
large
cities
The
giraffe
thrives
in
captivity
and
seems
to
be
well
satisfied
with
a
diet
of
corn
and
hay
It
is
a
source
of
great
satisfaction
to
those
who
admire
this
beautiful
animal
that
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
it
from
living
in
a
climate
so
different
from
that
of
its
African
home

THE
PET
LAMB
WORDSWORTH
Illustration
The
dew
was
falling
fast
the
stars
began
to
blink
I
heard
a
voice
it
said
Drink
pretty
creature
drink
And
looking
o
er
the
hedge
before
me
I
espied
A
snow
white
mountain
lamb
with
a
maiden
at
its
side
No
other
sheep
were
near
the
lamb
was
all
alone
And
by
a
slender
cord
was
tethered
to
a
stone
With
one
knee
on
the
grass
did
the
little
maiden
kneel
While
to
that
mountain
lamb
she
gave
its
evening
meal
The
lamb
while
from
her
hand
he
thus
his
supper
took
Seemed
to
feast
with
head
and
ears
and
his
tail
with
pleasure
shook
Drink
pretty
creature
drink
she
said
in
such
a
tone
That
I
almost
received
her
heart
into
my
own
Twas
little
Barbara
Lewthwaite
a
child
of
beauty
rare
I
watched
them
with
delight
they
were
a
lovely
pair
Now
with
her
empty
can
the
maiden
turned
away
But
ere
ten
yards
were
gone
her
footsteps
did
she
stay
Towards
the
lamb
she
looked
and
from
that
shady
place
I
unobserved
could
see
the
workings
of
her
face
If
Nature
to
her
tongue
could
measured
numbers
bring
Thus
thought
I
to
her
lamb
that
little
maid
might
sing
What
ails
thee
young
one
What
Why
pull
so
at
thy
cord
Is
it
not
well
with
thee
Well
both
for
bed
and
board
Thy
plot
of
grass
is
soft
and
green
as
grass
can
be
Rest

young
one
rest
what
is
t
that
aileth
thee
What
is
it
thou
wouldst
seek
What
is
wanting
to
thy
heart
Thy
limbs
are
they
not
strong
And
beautiful
thou
art
This
grass
is
tender
grass
these
flowers
they
have
no
peers
And
that
green
corn
all
day
is
rustling
in
thy
ears
If
the
sun

shining
hot

but
stretch
thy
woollen

This
beech
is
standing
by
its
covert

For

storms

The
rain
and
storm
are
things
that
scarcely

here
Rest

rest
thou
hast
forgot
the
day
When
my
father
found
thee
first
in
places
far
away
Many
flocks
were
on
the
hills
but
thou
wert
owned
by
none
And
thy
mother
from
thy
side
for
evermore
was
gone
He

THE
CAMEL
In
Asia
and
in
Africa
there
are
vast
plains
of
sand
upon
which
no
grass
grows
and
through
which
no
river
runs
These
plains
are
as
smooth
as
the
ocean
unmoved
by
waves
As
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
nothing
is
to
be
seen
but
sand
In
the
middle
of
the
day
when
the
sun
is
hottest
the
sand
dazzles
the
eyes
of
the
traveller
as
if
there
were
a
sun
beneath
the
sand
as
well
as
one
above
Here
and
there
but
many
miles
apart
are
green
spots
consisting
of
bushes
trees
and
grass
growing
around
a
small
pool
or
spring
of
water
These
green
spots
are
called
oases
Here
the
tired
traveller
can
find
food
and
shade
and
can
sleep
awhile
sheltered
from
the
blazing
sun
How
do
you
think
the
traveller
crosses
these
burning
plains
Not
in
carriages
nor
on
horseback
nor
in
railroad
trains
but
on
the
backs
of
tall
long
necked
humpbacked
camels
Even
if
you
have
seen
camels
alive
or
pictures
of
them
you
will
still
be
glad
to
learn
more
about
these
very
useful
animals
The
camel
lives
on
grass
and
the
dry
short
herbage
which
is
found
on
the
edges
of
the
desert
While
travelling
in
the
desert
it
is
fed
upon
dates
and
barley
It
is
able
to
eat
a
great
deal
of
food
at
a
time
and
to
drink
enough
water
to
last
some
days
By
this
means
it
can
go
for
a
long
time
without
food
and
travel
long
distances
without
stopping
to
eat
or
drink
The
camel
has
a
curious
lump
of
fat
on
the
top
of
its
back
called
a
hump
One
kind
of
camel
has
two
humps
One
purpose
of
these
humps
is
to
supply
the
camel
with
strength
when
it
has
neither
food
nor
water
and
would
otherwise
die
from
want
The
foot
of
the
camel
is
a
wonderful
thing
It
is
broad
and
has
a
soft
pad
at
the
bottom
which
keeps
it
from
sinking
in
the
yielding
sand
when
the
camel
crosses
the
arid
deserts
Illustration
The
camel
with
two
humps
on
its
back
is
much
larger
and
stronger
than
the
camel
with
one
hump
The
one
humped
camel
is
known
as
the
Arabian
camel
or
dromedary
Asia
is
the
home
of
the
camel
but
numbers
of
them
are
used
in
Africa
and
other
parts
of
the
world
The
camel
is
trained
to
kneel
down
to
receive
its
load
and
to
let
its
master
get
on
its
back
The
camel
can
smell
water
at
a
great
distance
When
its
rider
is
nearly
dead
from
thirst
and
water
is
near
he
can
tell
it
by
the
greater
speed
at
which
the
camel
begins
to
travel
The
camel
is
often
called
the
ship
of
the
desert
As
the
desert
is
like
a
sea
and
the
green
spots
upon
it
like
islands
so
is
the
camel
like
a
ship
that
can
carry
the
traveller
from
one
point
to
another
quickly
and
safely
But
even
with
his
faithful
camel
the
traveller
does
not
care
to
cross
the
desert
alone
The
difficulties
of
keeping
in
the
right
track
and
the
fear
of
wild
Arabs
make
it
much
safer
for
a
number
of
travellers
to
cross
the
desert
together
Travellers
take
with
them
camel
drivers
and
men
who
know
the
way
to
look
after
the
beasts
when
they
stop
for
the
night
These
men
light
the
fires
cook
the
food
and
fill
the
large
skin
bottles
with
water
when
they
come
to
a
spring
The
travellers
camels
and
camel
drivers
together
form
what
is
called
a
caravan

WORDSWORTH
Illustration
Oft
I
had
heard
of
Lucy
Gray
And
when
I
crossed
the
wild
I
chanced
to
see
at
break
of
day
The
solitary
child
No
mate
no
comrade
Lucy
knew
She
dwelt
on
a
wide
moor
The
sweetest
thing
that
ever
grew
Beside
a
human
door
You
yet
may
spy
the
fawn
at
play
The
hare
upon
the
green
But
the
sweet
face
of
Lucy
Gray
Will
never
more
be
seen
To
night
will
be
a
stormy
night
You
to
the
town
must
go
And
take
a
lantern
child
to
light
Your
mother
through
the
snow
That
father
will
I
gladly
do
Tis
scarcely
afternoon
The
minster
clock
has
just
struck
two
And
yonder
is
the
moon
At
this
the
father
raised
his
hook
And
snapped
a
fagot
band
He
plied
his
work
and
Lucy
took
The
lantern
in
her
hand
Not
blither
is
the
mountain
roe
With
many
a
wanton
stroke
Her
feet
disperse
the
powdery
snow
That
rises
up
like
smoke
The
storm
came
on
before
its
time
She
wandered
up
and
down
And
many
a
hill
did
Lucy
climb
But
never
reached
the
town
The
wretched
parents
all
that
night
Went
shouting
far
and
wide
But
there
was
neither
sound
nor
sight
To
serve
them
for
a
guide
At
daybreak
on
a
hill
they
stood
That
overlooked
the
moor
And
thence
they
saw
the
bridge
of
wood
A
furlong
from
their
door
They
wept
and
turning
homeward
cried
In
heaven
we
all
shall
meet
When
in
the
snow
the
mother
spied
The
print
of
Lucy
s
feet
Then
downward
from
the
steep
hill
s
edge
They
tracked
the
footmarks
small
And
through
the
broken
hawthorn
hedge
And
by
the
long
stone
wall
And
then
an
open
field
they
crossed
The
marks
were
still
the
same
They
tracked
them
on
nor
ever
lost
And
to
the
bridge
they
came
They
followed
from
the
snowy
bank
Those
footmarks
one
by
one
Into
the
middle
of
the
plank
And
further
there
were
none
Yet
some
maintain
that
to
this
day
She
is
a
living

may
see
sweet

Upon

O

THE
EMPEROR
AND
THE
MAJOR
The
Emperor
Alexander
while
travelling
in
Western
Russia
came
one
day
to
a
small
town
of
which
he
knew
very
little
so
when
he
found
that
he
must
change
horses
he
thought
that
he
would
look
around
and
see
what
the
town
was
like
Illustration
Alone
habited
in
a
plain
military
coat
without
any
mark
of
his
high
rank
he
wandered
through
the
place
until
he
came
to
the
end
of
the
road
that
he
had
been
following
There
he
paused
not
knowing
which
way
to
turn
for
two
paths
were
before
him
one
to
the
right
and
one
to
the
left
Alexander
saw
a
man
standing
at
the
door
of
a
house
and
going
up
to
him
the
Emperor
said
My
friend
can
you
tell
me
which
of
these
two
roads
I
must
take
to
get
to
Kalouga
The
man
who
was
in
full
military
dress
was
smoking
a
pipe
with
an
air
of
dignity
almost
ridiculous
Astonished
that
so
plain
looking
a
traveller
should
dare
to
speak
to
him
with
familiarity
the
smoker
answered
shortly
To
the
right
Pardon
said
the
Emperor
Another
word
if
you
please
What
was
the
haughty
reply
Permit
me
to
ask
you
a
question
continued
the
Emperor
What
is
your
grade
in
the
army
Guess
And
the
pipe
blazed
away
furiously
Lieutenant
said
the
amused
Alexander
Up
came
proudly
from
the
smoker
s
lips
Captain
Higher
Major
At
last
was
the
lofty
response
The
Emperor
bowed
low
in
the
presence
of
such
greatness
Now
in
my
turn
said
the
major
with
the
grand
air
that
he
thought
fit
to
assume
in
addressing
a
humble
inferior
what
are
you
if
you
please
Guess
answered
Alexander
Lieutenant
Up
Captain
Higher
Major
Go
on
Colonel
Again
The
smoker
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
Your
Excellency
is
then
General
The
grand
air
was
fast
disappearing
You
are
coming
near
it
The
major
put
his
hand
to
his
cap
Then
your
Highness
is
Field
Marshal
By
this
time
the
grand
air
had
taken
flight
and
the
officer
so
pompous
a
moment
before
looked
as
if
the
steady
gaze
and
the
quiet
voice
of
the
traveller
had
reduced
him
to
the
last
stage
of
fear
Once
more
my
good
major
said
Alexander
His
Imperial
Majesty
exclaimed
the
man
in
surprise
and
terror
letting
his
pipe
drop
from
his
trembling
fingers
His
very
self
answered
the
Emperor
and
he
smiled
at
the
wonderful
change
in
the
major
s
face
and
manner
Ah
Sire
pardon
me
cried
the
officer
falling
on
his
knees
pardon
me
And
what
is
there
to
pardon
said
Alexander
with
real
simple
dignity
My
friend
you
have
done
me
no
harm
I
asked
you
which
road
I
should
take
and
you
told
me
Thanks
But
the
major
never
forgot
the
lesson
If
in
later
years
he
was
tempted
to
be
rude
or
haughty
to
his
so
called
inferiors
there
rose
at
once
in
his
mind
a
picture
of
a
well
remembered
scene
in
which
his
pride
of
power
had
brought
such
shame
upon
him
Two
soldiers
in
a
quiet
country
town
made
but
an
every
day
picture
after
all
but
what
a
difference
there
had
been
between
the
pompous
manner
of
the
petty
officer
and
the
natural
courteous

of
the

Eve
and
a
cold
snowy
evening
On
this
night
a
poor
little
girl
walked
along
the
street
with
naked
feet
benumbed
with
cold
and
carrying
in
her
hand
a
bundle
of
matches
which
she
had
been
trying
all
day
to
sell
but
in
vain
no
one
had
given
her
a
single
penny
The
snow
fell
fast
upon
her
pretty
yellow
hair
and
her
bare
neck
but
she
did
not
mind
that
She
looked
wistfully
at
the
bright
lights
which
shone
from
every
window
as
she
passed
along
she
could
smell
the
nice
roast
goose
and
she
longed
to
taste
it
it
was
New
Year
s
Eve
Wearied
and
faint
she
laid
herself
down
in
a
corner
of
the
street
and
drew
her
little
legs
under
her
to
keep
herself
warm
She
could
not
go
home
for
her
father
would
scold
her
for
not
having
sold
any
matches
and
even
if
she
were
there
she
would
still
be
cold
for
the
house
was
but
poorly
protected
and
the
wind
whistled
through
many
a
chink
in
the
roof
and
walls
She
thought
she
would
try
and
warm
her
cold
fingers
by
lighting
one
of
the
matches
she
drew
one
out
struck
it
against
the
wall
and
immediately
a
bright
clear
flame
streamed
from
it
like
a
little
candle
The
little
girl
looked
at
the
flame
and
she
saw
before
her
a
beautiful
brass
stove
with
a
nice
warm
fire
in
it
She
stretched
out
her
feet
to
warm
them
when
lo
the
match
went
out
in
a
moment
the
stove
and
fire
vanished
she
sat
again
in
the
cold
night
with
the
burnt
match
in
her
hand
She
struck
another
the
flame
blazed
on
the
opposite
wall
and
she
saw
through
it
into
a
room
where
a
table
was
laid
out
with
handsome
dishes
roast
goose
and
other
nice
things
were
there
and
what
was
still
more
extraordinary
she
saw
the
goose
jump
from
the
dish
knife
and
fork
and
all
and
come
running
towards
her
But
again
the
match
went
out
and
nothing
but
the
dark
wall
and
the
cold
street
were
to
be
seen
The
little
girl
drew
another
match
and
as
soon
as
it
struck
a
light
she
saw
a
most
beautiful
Christmas
tree
much
larger
and
more
splendid
than
any
she
had
ever
seen
before
A
vast
number
of
lighted
candles
hung
among
the
branches
and
a
multitude
of
pretty
variegated
pictures
like
those
in
the
shops
met
her
eyes
The
girl
lifted
up
her
little
hands
in
rapture
at
the
sight
but
again
the
match
fell
and
in
the
same
moment
one
of
the
blazing
candles
shot
through
the
sky
like
a
falling
star
and
fell
at
her
feet
Now
some
one
dies
cried
she
for
she
had
been
told
by
her
good
old
grandmother
that
when
a
star
falls
a
soul
returns
to
God
Again
she
struck
and
behold
a
bright
light
shone
round
about
her
and
in
the
midst
of
it
stood
her
kind
grandmother
looking
calmly
and
smilingly
upon
her
Dear
grandmother
said
she
take
me
oh
take
me
You
will
be
gone
from
me
when
the
match
goes
out
like
the
bright
stove
the
nice
supper
and
the
Christmas
tree
and
saying
this
she
struck
all
the
rest
of
the
matches
at
once
which
made
a
light
round
her
almost
like
day
And
now
the
good
grandmother
smiled
still
more
sweetly
upon
her
she
lifted
her
up
in
her
arms
and
they
soared
together
far
far
away
where
there
was
no
longer
any
cold
or
hunger
or
pain
they
were
in
Paradise
But
the
poor
little
match
girl
was
still
in
the
corner
of
the
street
in
the
cold
New
Year
s
morning
She
was
frozen
to
death
and
a
bundle
of
burnt
matches
lay
beside
her
People
said
She
has
been
trying
to
warm
herself
poor
thing
But
ah
they
knew
not
what
glorious
things
she
had
seen
they
knew
not
into
what
joys
she
had
entered
nor
how
happy
she
was
on
this
festival
of
the
New
Year

THE
RHINOCEROS
Next
to
the
mighty
elephant
the
rhinoceros
is
the
largest
and
strongest
of
animals
There
are
several
species
of
the
rhinoceros
some
of
which
are
found
in
Asia
and
others
in
different
parts
of
Africa
In
the
latter
country
there
are
four
varieties
the
black
rhinoceros
having
a
single
horn
a
black
species
having
two
horns
the
long
horned
white
rhinoceros
and
the
common
white
species
which
has
a
short
stubby
horn
The
largest
of
the
African
species
is
the
long
horned
white
or
square
nosed
rhinoceros
When
full
grown
it
sometimes
measures
eighteen
feet
in
length
and
about
as
many
feet
around
the
body
Its
horn
frequently
grows
to
the
length
of
thirty
inches
The
black
rhinoceros
although
much
smaller
than
the
white
and
seldom
having
a
horn
over
eighteen
inches
long
is
far
more
ferocious
than
the
white
species
and
possesses
a
wonderful
degree
of
strength
The
form
of
the
rhinoceros
is
clumsy
and
its
appearance
dull
and
heavy
The
limbs
are
thick
and
powerful
and
each
foot
has
three
toes
which
are
covered
with
broad
hoof
like
nails
The
tail
is
small
the
head
very
long
and
large
Taken
altogether
there
are
few
if
any
animals
that
compare
with
the
rhinoceros
in
ugliness
The
eyes
are
set
in
such
a
manner
that
the
animal
can
not
see
anything
exactly
in
front
of
it
but
the
senses
of
hearing
and
smelling
are
so
keen
that
sight
is
not
required
to
detect
an
enemy
whether
it
be
man
or
beast
The
skin
of
the
African
rhinoceros
is
smooth
and
has
only
a
few
scattering
hairs
here
and
there
It
is
however
very
thick
and
tough
and
can
resist
the
force
of
a
rifle
ball
except
when
it
is
fired
from
a
very
short
distance
The
largest
known
species
of
the
rhinoceros
is
found
in
Asia
It
lives
chiefly
in
the
marshy
jungles
and
on
the
banks
of
lakes
and
rivers
in
India
Some
of
this
species
are
over
five
feet
in
height
and
have
horns
three
feet
in
length
and
eighteen
inches
around
the
base
Unlike
that
of
the
African
rhinoceros
the
skin
of
the
Asiatic
species
is
not
smooth
but
lies
in
thick
folds
upon
the
body
forming
flaps
which
can
be
lifted
with
the
hand
The
food
of
the
rhinoceros
consists
of
roots
and
the
young
branches
and
leaves
of
trees
and
shrubs
It
ploughs
up
the
roots
with
the
aid
of
its
horn
and
gathers
the
branches
and
leaves
with
its
upper
lip
which
is
long
and
pointed
and
with
it
rolls
its
food
together
before
placing
it
in
its
mouth
The
flesh
of
the
rhinoceros
is
good
to
eat
and
its
strong
thick
skin
is
made
by
the
natives
into
shields
whips
and
other
articles
Though
clumsy
and
apparently
very
stupid
the
rhinoceros
is
a
very
active
animal
when
attacked
or
otherwise
alarmed
It
is
very
fierce
and
savage
so
much
so
that
the
natives
dread
it
more
than
they
do
the
lion
In
hunting
the
rhinoceros
it
is
dangerous
for
a
man
to
fire
at
one
unless
he
is
mounted
upon
a
swift
horse
and
can
easily
reach
some
place
of
safety
When
attacking
an
enemy
the
rhinoceros
lowers
its
head
and
rushes
forward
like
an
angry
bull
Though
it
may
not
see
the
object
of
its
attack
its
sense
of
smell
is
so
acute
that
it
knows
when
the
enemy
is
reached
Then
begins
a
furious
tossing
of
the
head
and
if
its
powerful
horn
strikes
the
foe
a
terrible
wound
is
the
result
When
wounded
itself
the
rhinoceros
loses
all
sense
of
fear
and
charges
again
and
again
with
such
desperate
fury
that
the
enemy
is
almost
always
overcome
Illustration
A
famous
traveller
in
South
Africa
relates
the
following
incident
that
happened
during
one
of
his
hunting
excursions
Having
proceeded
about
two
miles
I
came
upon
a
black
rhinoceros
feeding
within
fifty
yards
of
me
I
fired
from
my
saddle
and
sent
a
bullet
in
behind
his
shoulder
upon
which
he
rushed
forward
blowing
like
a
grampus
and
then
stood
looking
about
him
Presently
he
started
off
and
I
followed
I
expected
that
he
would
come
to
bay
but
it
seems
a
rhinoceros
never
does
that
a
fact
I
did
not
know
at
that
time
Suddenly
he
fell
flat
upon
the
ground
but
soon
recovering
his
feet
he
resumed
his
course
as
if
nothing
had
happened
I
spurred
on
my
horse
dashed
ahead
and
rode
right
in
his
path
Upon
this
the
hideous
monster
charged
me
in
the
most
resolute
manner
blowing
loudly
through
his
nostrils
Although
I
quickly
turned
about
he
followed
me
at
such
a
furious
pace
for
several
hundred
yards
with
his
horrid
horny
snout
within
a
few
yards
of
my
horse
s
tail
that
I
thought
my
destruction
was
certain
The
animal
however
suddenly
turned
and
ran
in
another
direction
I
had
now
become
so
excited
with
the
incident
that
I
determined
to
give
him
one
more
shot
any
way
Nerving
my
horse
again
I
made
another
dash
after
the
rhinoceros
and
coming
up
pretty
close
to
him
I
again
fired
though
with
little
effect
the
ball
striking
some
thick
portion
of
the
skin
and
doing
no
harm
Not
caring
to
run
the
chance
of
the
huge
brute
again
charging
me
and
believing
that
my
rifle
ball
was
not
powerful
enough
to
kill
him
I
determined
to
give
up
the
pursuit
and
accordingly
let
him
run
off
while
I
returned
to
the
camp
XIII
THE
OLD
ARM
CHAIR
ELIZA
COOK
I
love
it
I
love
it
and
who
shall
dare
To
chide
me
for
loving
that
old
arm
chair
I
ve
treasured
it
long
as
a
sainted
prize
I
ve
bedewed
it
with
tears
and
embalmed
it
with
sighs
Tis
bound
by
a
thousand
bands
to
my
heart
Not
a
tie
will
break
not
a
link
will
start
Would
you
learn
the
spell
a
mother
sat
there
And
a
sacred
thing
is
that
old
arm
chair
In
childhood
s
hour
I
lingered
near
The
hallowed
seat
with
listening
ear
And
gentle
words
that
mother
would
give
To
fit
me
to
die
and
teach
me
to
live
She
told
me
shame
would
never
betide
With
truth
for
my
creed
and
God
for
my
guide
She
taught
me
to
lisp
my
earliest
prayer
As
I
knelt
beside
that
old
arm
chair
I
sat
and
watched
her
many
a
day
When
her
eyes
grew
dim
and
her
locks
were
gray
And
I
almost
worshipped
her
when
she
smiled
And
turned
from
her
Bible
to
bless
her
child
Years
rolled
on
but
the
last
one
sped
My
idol
was
shattered
my
earth
star
fled
I
learned
how
much
the
heart
can
bear
When
I
saw
her
die
in
that
old
arm
chair
Tis
past
tis
past
but
I
gaze
on
it
now
With
quivering
breath
and
throbbing
brow
Twas
there
she
nursed
me
twas
there
she
died
And
memory
flows
with
lava
tide
Say
it
is
folly
and
deem
me
weak
While
the
scalding
drops
start
down
my
cheek
But
I
love
it
I
love
it
and
cannot
tear
My
soul
from
a
mother
s
old
arm
chair

XV
PRINCE
ARTHUR
DICKENS
At
two
and
thirty
years
of
age
in
the
year
John
became
king
of
England
His
pretty
little
nephew
Arthur
had
the
best
claim
to
the
throne
but
John
seized
the
treasure
and
made
fine
promises
to
the
nobility
and
got
himself
crowned
at
Westminster
within
a
few
weeks
after
his
brother
Richard
s
death
I
doubt
whether
the
crown
could
possibly
have
been
put
upon
the
head
of
a
meaner
coward
or
a
more
detestable
villain
if
the
country
had
been
searched
from
end
to
end
to
find
him
out
The
French
king
Philip
refused
to
acknowledge
the
right
of
John
to
his
new
dignity
and
declared
in
favor
of
Arthur
You
must
not
suppose
that
he
had
any
generosity
of
feeling
for
the
fatherless
boy
it
merely
suited
his
ambitious
schemes
to
oppose
the
king
of
England
So
John
and
the
French
king
went
to
war
about
Arthur
He
was
a
handsome
boy
at
that
time
only
twelve
years
old
He
was
not
born
when
his
father
Geoffrey
had
his
brains
trampled
out
at
the
tournament
and
besides
the
misfortune
of
never
having
known
a
father
s
guidance
and
protection
he
had
the
additional
misfortune
to
have
a
foolish
mother
Constance
by
name
lately
married
to
her
third
husband
She
took
Arthur
upon
John
s
accession
to
the
French
king
who
pretended
to
be
very
much
his
friend
and
made
him
a
knight
and
promised
him
his
daughter
in
marriage
but
who
cared
so
little
about
him
in
reality
that
finding
it
his
interest
to
make
peace
with
King
John
for
a
time
he
did
so
without
the
least
consideration
for
the
poor
little
prince
and
heartlessly
sacrificed
all
his
interests
Young
Arthur
for
two
years
afterwards
lived
quietly
and
in
the
course
of
that
time
his
mother
died
But
the
French
king
then
finding
it
his
interest
to
quarrel
with
King
John
again
made
Arthur
his
pretence
and
invited
the
orphan
boy
to
court
You
know
your
rights
prince
said
the
French
king
and
you
would
like
to
be
a
king
Is
it
not
so
Truly
said
Prince
Arthur
I
should
greatly
like
to
be
a
king
Then
said
Philip
you
shall
have
two
hundred
gentlemen
who
are
knights
of
mine
and
with
them
you
shall
go
to
win
back
the
provinces
belonging
to
you
of
which
your
uncle
the
usurping
king
of
England
has
taken
possession
I
myself
meanwhile
will
head
a
force
against
him
in
Normandy
Prince
Arthur
went
to
attack
the
town
of
Mirebeau
because
his
grandmother
Eleanor
was
living
there
and
because
his
knights
said
Prince
if
you
can
take
her
prisoner
you
will
be
able
to
bring
the
king
your
uncle
to
terms
But
she
was
not
to
be
easily
taken
She
was
old
enough
by
this
time
eighty
but
she
was
as
full
of
stratagem
as
she
was
full
of
years
and
wickedness
Receiving
intelligence
of
young
Arthur
s
approach
she
shut
herself
up
in
a
high
tower
and
encouraged
her
soldiers
to
defend
it
like
men
Prince
Arthur
with
his
little
army
besieged
the
high
tower
King
John
hearing
how
matters
stood
came
up
to
the
rescue
with
his
army
So
here
was
a
strange
family
party
The
boy
prince
besieging
his
grandmother
and
his
uncle
besieging
him
This
position
of
affairs
did
not
last
long
One
summer
night
King
John
by
treachery
got
his
men
into
the
town
surprised
Prince
Arthur
s
force
took
two
hundred
of
his
knights
and
seized
the
prince
himself
in
his
bed
The
knights
were
put
in
heavy
irons
and
driven
away
in
open
carts
drawn
by
bullocks
to
various
dungeons
where
they
were
most
inhumanly
treated
and
where
some
of
them
were
starved
to
death
Prince
Arthur
was
sent
to
the
Castle
of
Falaise
One
day
while
he
was
in
prison
at
that
castle
mournfully
thinking
it
strange
that
one
so
young
should
be
in
so
much
trouble
and
looking
out
of
the
small
window
in
the
deep
dark
wall
at
the
summer
sky
and
the
birds
the
door
was
softly
opened
and
he
saw
his
uncle
the
king
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
archway
looking
very
grim
Arthur
said
the
king
with
his
wicked
eyes
more
on
the
stone
floor
than
on
his
nephew
will
you
not
trust
to
the
gentleness
the
friendship
and
the
truthfulness
of
your
loving
uncle
I
will
tell
my
loving
uncle
that
replied
the
boy
when
he
does
me
right
Let
him
restore
to
me
my
kingdom
of
England
and
then
come
to
me
and
ask
the
question
The
king
looked
at
him
and
went
out
Keep
that
boy
a
close
prisoner
said
he
to
the
warden
of
the
castle
Then
the
king
took
secret
counsel
with
the
worst
of
his
nobles
how
the
prince
was
to
be
got
rid
of
Some
said
Put
out
his
eyes
and
keep
him
in
prison
as
Robert
of
Normandy
was
kept
Others
said
Have
him
stabbed
Others
Have
him
poisoned
King
John
feeling
that
in
any
case
whatever
was
done
afterwards
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
his
mind
to
have
those
handsome
eyes
burnt
out
that
had
looked
at
him
so
proudly
while
his
own
royal
eyes
were
blinking
at
the
stone
floor
sent
certain
ruffians
to
Falaise
to
blind
the
boy
with
red
hot
irons
But
Arthur
so
pathetically
entreated
them
and
shed
such
piteous
tears
and
so
appealed
to
Hubert
de
Bourg
or
Burgh
the
warden
of
the
castle
who
had
a
love
for
him
and
was
a
merciful
tender
man
that
Hubert
could
not
bear
it
To
his
eternal
honor
he
prevented
the
torture
from
being
performed
and
at
his
own
risk
sent
the
savages
away
The
chafed
and
disappointed
king
bethought
himself
of
the
stabbing
suggestion
next
and
with
his
shuffling
manner
and
his
cruel
face
proposed
it
to
one
William
de
Bray
I
am
a
gentleman
and
not
an
executioner
said
William
de
Bray
and
left
the
presence
with
disdain
But
it
was
not
difficult
for
a
king
to
hire
a
murderer
in
those
days
King
John
found
one
for
his
money
and
sent
him
down
to
the
castle
of
Falaise
On
what
errand
dost
thou
come
said
Hubert
to
this
fellow
To
despatch
young
Arthur
he
returned
Go
back
to
him
who
sent
thee
answered
Hubert
and
say
that
I
will
do
it
King
John
very
well
knowing
that
Hubert
would
never
do
it
but
that
he
evasively
sent
this
reply
to
save
the
prince
or
gain
time
despatched
messengers
to
convey
the
young
prisoner
to
the
castle
of
Rouen
Arthur
was
soon
forced
from
the
kind
Hubert
of
whom
he
had
never
stood
in
greater
need
than
then
carried
away
by
night
and
lodged
in
his
new
prison
where
through
his
grated
window
he
could
hear
the
deep
waters
of
the
river
Seine
rippling
against
the
stone
wall
below
One
dark
night
as
he
lay
sleeping
dreaming
perhaps
of
rescue
by
those
unfortunate
gentlemen
who
were
obscurely
suffering
and
dying
in
his
cause
he
was
roused
and
bidden
by
his
jailor
to
come
down
the
staircase
to
the
foot
of
the
tower
He
hurriedly
dressed
himself
and
obeyed
When
they
came
to
the
bottom
of
the
winding
stairs
the
jailor
trod
upon
his
torch
and
put
it
out
Then
Arthur
in
the
darkness
was
hurriedly
drawn
into
a
solitary
boat
and
in
that
boat
he
found
his
uncle
and
one
other
man
He
knelt
to
them
and
prayed
them
not
to
murder
him
Deaf
to
his
entreaties
they
stabbed
him
and
sank
his
body
in
the
river
with
heavy
stones
When
the
spring
morning
broke
the
tower
door
was
closed
the
boat
was
gone
the
river
sparkled
on
its
way
and
never
more
was
any
trace
of
the
poor
boy
beheld
by
mortal
eyes

THE
HIPPOPOTAMUS
Illustration
Of
all
the
ugly
looking
animals
the
hippopotamus
is
certainly
one
of
the
ugliest
Its
name
means
the
river
horse
and
was
given
it
because
it
is
generally
found
either
in
rivers
or
their
neighborhood
but
the
hippopotamus
is
nothing
like
a
horse
either
in
its
form
or
its
habits
Though
it
rarely
exceeds
five
feet
in
height
it
is
of
vast
bulk
and
when
full
grown
will
weigh
it
is
said
as
much
as
four
or
five
oxen
The
head
is
of
enormous
size
and
provided
with
a
mouth
of
alarming
width
The
skin
which
is
of
a
dark
color
and
thinly
covered
with
short
white
hairs
is
in
places
nearly
two
inches
thick
The
feet
are
large
and
divided
into
four
parts
each
of
which
is
protected
by
a
hoof
The
hippopotamus
lives
entirely
upon
vegetable
food
of
which
it
eats
vast
quantities
as
much
as
six
bushels
of
grass
having
been
found
in
its
stomach
But
it
is
not
so
much
the
amount
of
food
which
it
consumes
as
what
it
destroys
that
makes
the
African
dread
its
visits
to
the
standing
crops
Its
body
is
so
huge
and
its
legs
are
so
short
that
it
tramples
down
far
more
than
it
eats
It
is
provided
with
a
tremendous
array
of
teeth
some
of
which
weigh
from
five
to
eight
pounds
With
these
it
cuts
down
the
grass
and
shrubs
on
which
it
lives
as
if
they
were
mown
with
a
scythe
The
hippopotamus
in
spite
of
its
awkward
form
is
an
excellent
swimmer
and
diver
and
can
remain
under
water
for
as
much
as
ten
minutes
During
the
first
few
months
of
its
life
the
young
hippopotamus
is
carried
upon
its
mother
s
neck
When
born
it
is
not
much
larger
than
a
terrier
dog
The
hippopotamus
is
caught
in
various
ways
Sometimes
several
pitfalls
having
sharp
stakes
at
the
bottom
are
dug
across
the
path
which
it
pursues
In
the
darkness
of
the
night
it
falls
into
one
of
these
and
is
impaled
on
the
stakes
This
is
a
very
cruel
mode
of
capture
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
natives
who
employ
it
soon
put
the
poor
animal
out
of
its
misery
It
is
not
easy
to
shoot
it
fatally
for
once
it
is
alarmed
it
does
not
readily
show
itself
It
just
pushes
up
its
nostrils
above
the
water
to
take
in
air
often
selecting
for
this
purpose
some
spot
where
the
reeds
conceal
its
movements
and
then
sinks
again
Sometimes
the
hippopotamus
is
harpooned
like
a
whale
As
soon
as
it
is
struck
with
the
harpoon
the
hunters
fasten
the
line
round
a
neighboring
tree
and
so
hold
their
prey
tight
until
it
is
despatched
Or
if
there
is
no
time
for
them
to
get
to
land
they
throw
the
line
with
a
buoy
attached
to
it
into
the
water
The
hippopotamus
is
then
pursued
in
canoes
and
every
time
it
rises
to
the
surface
it
is
pierced
with
javelins
until
at
length
it
dies
from
loss
of
blood
This
is
dangerous
sport
for
it
sometimes
turns
upon
the
hunters
and
crushes
in
or
capsizes
their
canoes
Once
a
hippopotamus
whose
calf
had
been
speared
on
the
previous
day
attacked
a
boat
in
which
was
Dr
Livingstone
She
struck
it
with
such
violence
that
the
forepart
was
lifted
clean
out
of
the
water
one
of
the
negro
boatmen
was
thrown
into
the
river
and
the
whole
crew
were
forced
to
jump
ashore
Between
the
skin
and
the
flesh
is
a
layer
of
fat
which
is
considered
a
great
delicacy
The
flesh
also
is
very
good
eating
The
hide
is
made
into
shields
whips
and
walking
sticks
The
teeth
yield
a
beautiful
white
ivory
which
is
much
valued
on
account
of
its
never
losing
color

Of

Triumphant

O

Which

He
leaps
and

Along

As

Where

When

Oft

Up

When

ROBERT

Illustration
It
was
a

evening
Old
Kaspar
s
work
was
done
And
he
before
his

door
Was
sitting

And
by
him
sported
on
the

His

She

Peterkin
Roll

He
came

man
shook
his
head
And
with
a
natural
sigh
Tis
some
poor
fellow
s
skull
said
he
Who
fell
in
the
great
victory
I
find
them
in
the
garden
For
there
s
many
here
about
And
often
when
I
go
to
plough
The
ploughshare
turns
them
out
For
many
thousand
men
said
he
Were
slain
in
that
great
victory
Now
tell
us
what
twas
all
about
Young
Peterkin
he
cries
And
little
Wilhelmine
looks
up
With
wonder
waiting
eyes
Now
tell
us
all
about
the
war
And
what
they
fought
each
other
for
It
was
the
English
Kaspar
cried
Who
put
the
French
to
rout
But
what
they
fought
each
other
for
I
could
not
well
make
out
But
everybody
said
quoth
he
That
twas
a
famous
victory
My
father
lived
at
Blenheim
then
Yon
little
stream
hard
by
They
burnt
his
dwelling
to
the
ground
And
he
was
forced
to
fly
So
with
his
wife
and
child
he
fled
Nor
had
he
where
to
rest
his
head
With
fire
and
sword
the
country
round
Was
wasted
far
and
wide
And
many
a
childing
mother
then
And
new
born
baby
died
But
things
like
that
you
know
must
be
At
every
famous
victory
They
say
it
was
a
shocking
sight
After
the
field
was
won
For
many
thousand
bodies
here
Lay
rotting
in
the
sun
But
things
like
that
you
know
must
be
After
a
famous
victory
Great
praise
the
Duke
of
Marlbro
won
And
our
good
Prince
Eugene
Why
twas
a
very
wicked
thing
Said
little
Wilhelmine
Nay
nay
my
little
girl
quoth
he
It
was
a
famous
victory
And
everybody
praised
the
Duke
Who
this
great
fight
did
win
But
what
good
came
of
it
at

Quoth

THE
BLACK
DOUGLAS
Illustration
King
Edward
I
of
England
commonly
known
as
Longshanks
nearly
conquered
Scotland
It
was
from
no
lack
of
spirit
or
energy
that
he
did
not
quite
complete
his
troublesome
task
but
he
died
a
little
too
soon
On
his
death
bed
he
called
his
pretty
spiritless
son
to
him
and
made
him
promise
to
carry
on
the
war
he
then
ordered
that
his
bones
should
be
wrapped
up
in
a
bull
s
hide
and
carried
at
the
head
of
the
army
in
future
campaigns
against
the
Scots
Edward
II
soon
forgot
his
promise
to
his
father
and
spent
his
time
in
dissipation
among
his
favorites
and
allowed
the
resolute
Scots
to
recover
Scotland
Good
James
Lord
Douglas
was
a
very
wise
man
in
his
day
He
may
not
have
had
long
shanks
but
he
had
a
very
long
head
as
you
shall
presently
see
He
was
one
of
the
hardest
foes
with
which
the
two
Edwards
had
to
contend
and
his
long
head
proved
quite
too
powerful
for
the
second
Edward
who
in
his
single
campaign
against
the
Scots
lost
at
Bannockburn
nearly
all
that
his
father
had
gained
The
tall
Scottish
castle
of
Roxburgh
stood
near
the
border
lifting
its
grim
turrets
above
the
Teviot
and
the
Tweed
When
the
Black
Douglas
as
Lord
James
was
called
had
recovered
castle
after
castle
from
the
English
he
desired
to
gain
this
stronghold
and
determined
to
accomplish
his
wish
But
he
knew
it
could
be
taken
only
by
surprise
and
a
very
wily
affair
it
must
be
He
had
outwitted
the
English
so
many
times
that
they
were
sharply
on
the
look
out
for
him
How
could
it
be
done
Tis
an
old
Yule
log
story
and
you
shall
be
told
Near
the
castle
was
a
gloomy
old
forest
called
Jedburgh
Here
just
as
the
first
days
of
spring
began
to
kindle
in
the
sunrise
and
the
sunsets
and
warm
the
frosty
hills
Black
Douglas
concealed
sixty
picked
men
It
was
Shrove
tide
and
Fasten
s
Eve
immediately
before
the
great
Church
fast
of
Lent
was
to
be
celebrated
with
song
and
harp
and
a
great
blaze
of
light
and
free
offerings
of
wine
in
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
The
garrison
was
to
have
leave
for
merry
making
and
indulging
in
drunken
wassail
The
sun
had
gone
down
in
the
red
sky
and
the
long
deep
shadow
began
to
fall
on
Jedburgh
woods
the
river
the
hills
and
valleys
An
officer
s
wife
had
retired
from
the
great
hall
where
all
was
preparation
for
the
merry
making
to
the
high
battlements
of
the
castle
in
order
to
quiet
her
little
child
and
put
it
to
rest
The
sentinel
from
time
to
time
paced
near
her
She
began
to
sing
Hush
ye
hush
ye
little
pet
ye
Hush
ye
hush
ye
do
not
fret
ye
The
Black
Douglas
shall
not
get
ye
She
saw
some
strange
objects
moving
across
the
level
ground
in
the
distance
They
greatly
puzzled
her
They
did
not
travel
quite
like
animals
but
they
seemed
to
have
four
legs
What
are
those
queer
looking
things
yonder
she
asked
of
the
sentinel
as
he
drew
near
They
are
Farmer
Asher
s
cattle
said
the
soldier
straining
his
eyes
to
discern
the
outlines
of
the
long
figures
in
the
shadows
The
good
man
is
making
merry
to
night
and
has
forgotten
to
bring
in
his
oxen
lucky
twill
be
if
they
do
not
fall
a
prey
to
the
Black
Douglas
So
sure
was
he
that
the
objects
were
cattle
that
he
ceased
to
watch
them
longer
The
woman
s
eye
however
followed
the
queer
looking
cattle
for
some
time
until
they
seemed
to
disappear
under
the
outer
works
of
the
castle
Then
feeling
quite
at
ease
she
thought
she
would
sing
again
Spring
was
in
the
evening
air
and
perhaps
it
was
the
joyousness
of
spring
which
made
her
sing
Now
the
name
of
the
Black
Douglas
had
become
so
terrible
to
the
English
that
it
was
used
to
frighten
the
children
who
when
they
misbehaved
were
told
that
the
Black
Douglas
would
get
them
The
little
ditty
I
have
quoted
must
have
been
very
quieting
to
good
children
in
those
alarming
times
So
the
good
woman
sang
cheerily
Hush
ye
hush
ye
little
pet
ye
Hush
ye
hush
ye
do
not
fret
ye
The
Black
Douglas
shall
not
get
ye
Do
not
be
so
sure
of
that
said
a
husky
voice
close
beside
her
and
a
mail
gloved
hand
fell
solidly
upon
her
shoulder
She
was
dreadfully
frightened
for
she
knew
from
the
appearance
of
the
man
he
must
be
the
Black
Douglas
The
Scots
came
leaping
over
the
walls
The
garrison
was
merry
making
below
and
almost
before
the
disarmed
revellers
had
any
warning
the
Black
Douglas
was
in
the
midst
of
them
The
old
stronghold
was
taken
and
many
of
the
garrison
were
put
to
the
sword
but
the
Black
Douglas
spared
the
woman
and
the
child
who
probably
never
afterwards
felt
quite
so
sure
about
the
little
ditty
Hush
ye
hush
ye
do
not
fret
ye
The
Black
Douglas
shall
not
get
ye
Douglas
had
caused
his
picked
men
to
approach
the
castle
by
walking
on
their
hands
and
knees
with
long
black
cloaks
thrown
over
their
bodies
and
their
ladders
and
weapons
concealed
under
their
cloaks
The
men
thus
presented
very
nearly
the
appearance
of
a
herd
of
cattle
in
the
deep
shadows
and
completely
deceived
the
sentinel
who
was
probably
thinking
more
of
the
music
and
dancing
below
than
of
the
watchful
enemy
who
had
been
haunting
the
gloomy
woods
of
Jedburgh
The
Black
Douglas
or
Good
James
Lord
Douglas
as
he
was
called
by
the
Scots
fought
as
you
will
afterwards
read
with
King
Robert
Bruce
at
Bannockburn
One
lovely
June
day
in
the
far
gone
year
of
King
Robert
lay
dying
He
called
Douglas
to
his
bedside
and
told
him
that
it
had
been
one
of
the
dearest
wishes
of
his
heart
to
go
to
the
Holy
Land
and
recover
Jerusalem
from
the
Infidels
but
since
he
could
not
go
he
wished
him
to
embalm
his
heart
after
his
death
and
carry
it
to
the
Holy
City
and
deposit
it
in
the
Holy
Sepulchre
Douglas
had
the
heart
of
Bruce
embalmed
and
enclosed
in
a
silver
case
and
wore
it
on
a
silver
chain
about
his
neck
He
set
out
for
Jerusalem
but
resolved
first
to
visit
Spain
and
engage
in
the
war
waged
against
the
Moorish
king
of
Granada
He
fell
in
Andalusia
in
battle
Just
before
his
death
he
threw
the
silver
casket
into
the
thickest
of
the
fight
exclaiming
Heart
of
Bruce
I
follow
thee
or
die
His
dead
body
was
found
beside
the
casket
and
the
heart
of
Bruce
was
brought
back
to
Scotland
and
deposited
in
the
ivy
clad
Abbey
of
Melrose
Douglas
was
a
real
hero
and
few
things
more
engaging
than
his
exploits
were
ever
told
under
the
holly
and
mistletoe
or
in
the
warm
Christmas
light
of
the
old
Scottish

BRUCE
AND
THE
SPIDER
ELIZA
COOK
Illustration
King
Bruce
of
Scotland
flung
himself
down
in
a
lonely
mood
to
think
Tis
true
he
was
monarch
and
wore
a
crown
but
his
heart
was
beginning
to
sink
For
he
had
been
trying
to
do
a
great
deed
to
make
his
people
glad
He
had
tried
and
tried
but
couldn
t
succeed
and
so
he
became
quite
sad
He
flung
himself
down
in
low
despair
as
grieved
as
man
could
be
And
after
a
while
as
he
pondered
there
I
ll
give
it
all
up
said
he
Now
just
at
the
moment
a
spider
dropped
with
its
silken
cobweb
clew
And
the
king
in
the
midst
of
his
thinking
stopped
to
see
what
the
spider
would
do
Twas
a
long
way
up
to
the
ceiling
dome
and
it
hung
by
a
rope
so
fine
That
how
it
would
get
to
its
cobweb
home
King
Bruce
could
not
divine
It
soon
began
to
cling
and
crawl
straight
up
with
strong
endeavor
But
down
it
came
with
a
slipping
sprawl
as
near
to
the
ground
as
ever
Up
up
it
ran
not
a
second
it
stayed
to
utter
the
least
complaint
Till
it
fell
still
lower
and
there
it
lay
a
little
dizzy
and
faint
Its
head
grew
steady
again
it
went
and
travelled
a
half
yard
higher
Twas
a
delicate
thread
it
had
to
tread
and
a
road
where
its
feet
would
tire
Again
it
fell
and
swung
below
but
again
it
quickly
mounted
Till
up
and
down
now
fast
now
slow
nine
brave
attempts
were
counted
Sure
cried
the
king
that
foolish
thing
will
strive
no
more
to
climb
When
it
toils
so
hard
to
reach
and
cling
and
tumbles
every
time
But
up
the
insect
went
once
more
ah
me
tis
an
anxious
minute
He
s
only
a
foot
from
his
cobweb
door
oh
say
will
he
lose
or
win
it
Steadily
steadily
inch
by
inch
higher
and
higher
he
got
And
a
bold
little
run
at
the
very
last
pinch
put
him
into
his
native
spot
Bravo
bravo
the
king
cried
out
all
honor
to
those
who
try
The
spider
up
there
defied
despair
he
conquered
and
why
shouldn
t
I
And
Bruce
of
Scotland
braced
his
mind
and
gossips
tell
the
tale
That
he
tried
once
more
as
he
tried
before
and
that
time
he
did
not
fail
Pay

THE
FARMER
AND
THE
FOX
J
A
FROUDE
A
Farmer
whose
poultry
yard
had
suffered
severely
from
the
foxes
succeeded
at
last
in
catching
one
in
a
trap
Ah
you
rascal
said
he
as
he
saw
him
struggling
I
ll
teach
you
to
steal
my
fat
geese
You
shall
hang
on
the
tree
yonder
and
your
brothers
shall
see
what
comes
of
thieving
The
Farmer
was
twisting
a
halter
to
do
what
he
had
threatened
when
the
Fox
whose
tongue
had
helped
him
in
hard
pinches
before
thought
there
could
be
no
harm
in
trying
if
it
might
not
do
him
one
more
good
turn
You
will
hang
me
he
said
to
frighten
my
brother
foxes
On
the
word
of
a
fox
they
won
t
care
a
rabbit
skin
for
it
they
ll
come
and
look
at
me
but
you
may
depend
upon
it
they
will
dine
at
your
expense
before
they
go
home
again
Then
I
shall
hang
you
for
yourself
as
a
rogue
and
a
rascal
said
the
Farmer
I
am
only
what
Nature
or
whatever
you
call
the
thing
chose
to
make
me
the
Fox
answered
I
didn
t
make
myself
You
stole
my
geese
said
the
man
Why
did
Nature
make
me
like
geese
then
said
the
Fox
Live
and
let
live
give
me
my
share
and
I
won
t
touch
yours
but
you
keep
them
all
to
yourself
I
don
t
understand
your
fine
talk
answered
the
Farmer
but
I
know
that
you
are
a
thief
and
that
you
deserve
to
be
hanged
His
head
is
too
thick
to
let
me
catch
him
so
thought
the
Fox
I
wonder
if
his
heart
is
any
softer
You
are
taking
away
the
life
of
a
fellow
creature
he
said
that
s
a
responsibility
it
is
a
curious
thing
that
life
and
who
knows
what
comes
after
it
You
say
I
am
a
rogue
I
say
I
am
not
but
at
any
rate
I
ought
not
to
be
hanged
for
if
I
am
not
I
don
t
deserve
it
and
if
I
am
you
should
give
me
time
to
repent
I
have
him
now
thought
the
Fox
let
him
get
out
if
he
can
Why
what
would
you
have
me
do
with
you
said
the
man
My
notion
is
that
you
should
let
me
go
and
give
me
a
lamb
or
a
goose
or
two
every
month
and
then
I
could
live
without
stealing
but
perhaps
you
know
better
than
I
and
I
am
a
rogue
my
education
may
have
been
neglected
you
should
shut
me
up
and
take
care
of
me
and
teach
me
Who
knows
but
in
the
end
I
may
turn
into
a
dog
Very
pretty
said
the
Farmer
we
have
dogs
enough
and
more
too
than
we
can
take
care
of
without
you
No
no
Master
Fox
I
have
caught
you
and
you
shall
swing
whatever
is
the
logic
of
it
There
will
be
one
rogue
less
in
the
world
any
how
It
is
mere
hate
and
unchristian
vengeance
said
the
Fox
No
friend
the
Farmer
answered
I
don
t
hate
you
and
I
don
t
want
to
revenge
myself
on
you
but
you
and
I
can
t
get
on
together
and
I
think
I
am
of
more
importance
than
you
If
nettles
and
thistles
grow
in
my
cabbage
garden
I
don
t
try
and
persuade
them
to
grow

that
I

Written

Ottawa
in
the
summer
of
Faintly
as
tolls
the
evening

Our
voices
keep
tune
and
our
oars
keep

Soon
as
the
woods
on
the
shore
look
dim
We
ll
sing
at
St
Anne
s
our
parting
hymn
Row

row
the

runs
fast
The

are
near
and
the

Why
should
we
yet
our
sail
unfurl
There
is
not
a
breath
the
blue
wave
to
curl
But
when
the
wind
blows
off
the
shore
O
sweetly
we
ll
rest
our
weary

Blow

THE
WRECK
OF
THE
HESPERUS
LONGFELLOW
It
was
the
schooner
Hesperus
That
sailed
the
wintry
sea
And
the
skipper
had
taken
his
little
daughter
To
bear
him
company
Blue
were
her
eyes
as
the
fairy
flax
Her
cheeks
like
the
dawn
of
day
And
her
bosom
white
as
the
hawthorn
buds
That
ope
in
the
month
of
May
The
skipper
he
stood
beside
the
helm
His
pipe
was
in
his
mouth
And
he
watched
how
the
veering
flaw
did
blow
The
smoke
now
west
now
south
Then
up
and
spake
an
old
sailor
Had
sailed
the
Spanish
Main
I
pray
thee
put
into
yonder
port
For
I
fear
a
hurricane
Last
night
the
moon
had
a
golden
ring
And
to
night
no
moon
we
see
The
skipper
he
blew
a
whiff
from
his
pipe
And
a
scornful
laugh
laughed
he
Colder
and
louder
blew
the
wind
A
gale
from
the
north
east
The
snow
fell
hissing
in
the
brine
And
the
billows
frothed
like
yeast
Down
came
the
storm
and
smote
amain
The
vessel
in
its
strength
She
shuddered
and
paused
like
a
frighted
steed
Then
leaped
her
cable
s
length
Come
hither
come
hither
my
little
daughter
And
do
not
tremble
so
For
I
can
weather
the
roughest
gale
That
ever
wind
did
blow
He
wrapped
her
warm
in
his
seaman
s
coat
Against
the
stinging
blast
He
cut
a
rope
from
a
broken
spar
And
bound
her
to
the
mast
O
father
I
hear
the
church
bells
ring
O
say
what
may
it
be
Tis
a
fog
bell
on
a
rock
bound
coast
And
he
steered
for
the
open
sea
O
father
I
hear
the
sound
of
guns
O
say
what
may
it
be
Some
ship
in
distress
that
cannot
live
In
such
an
angry
sea
O
father
I
see
a
gleaming
light
O
say
what
may
it
be
But
the
father
answered
never
a
word
A
frozen
corpse
was
he
Lashed
to
the
helm
all
stiff
and
stark
With
his
face
turned
to
the
skies
The
lantern
gleamed
through
the
gleaming
snow
On
his
fixed
and
glassy
eyes
Then
the
maiden
clasped
her
hands
and
prayed
That
sav
d
she
might
be
And
she
thought
of
Him
who
stilled
the
wave
On
the
Lake
of
Galilee
And
fast
through
the
midnight
dark
and
drear
Through
the
whistling
sleet
and
snow
Like
a
sheeted
ghost
the
vessel
swept
Towards
the
reef
of
Norman
s
Woe
And
ever
the
fitful
gusts
between
A
sound
came
from
the
land
It
was
the
sound
of
the
trampling
surf
On
the
rocks
and
the
hard
sea
sand
The
breakers
were
right
beneath
her
bows
She
drifted
a
dreary
wreck
And
the
whooping
billow
swept
the
crew
Like
icicles
from
her
deck
She
struck
where
the
white
and
fleecy
waves
Looked
soft
as
carded
wool
But
the
cruel
rocks
they
gored
her
side
Like
the
horns
of
an
angry
bull
Her
rattling
shrouds
all
sheathed
in
ice
With
the
masts
went
by
the
board
Like
a
vessel
of
glass
she
stove
and
sank
Ho
Ho
the
breakers
roared
At
daybreak
on
the
bleak
sea
beach
A
fisherman
stood
aghast
To
see
the
form
of
a
maiden
fair
Lashed
close
to
a
drifting
mast
The
salt
sea
was
frozen
on
her
breast
The
salt
tears
in
her
eyes
And
he
saw
her
hair
like
the
brown
sea
weed
On
the
billows
fall
and
rise
Such
was
the
wreck
of
the
Hesperus
In
the
midnight
and
the
snow
Oh
save
us
all
from
a

HOLLAND
MARY
MAPES
DODGE
Dutch
cities
seem
at
first
sight
to
be
a
bewildering
jumble
of
houses
bridges
churches
and
ships
sprouting
into
masts
steeples
and
trees
In
some
cities
boats
are
hitched
like
horses
to
their
owners
door
posts
and
receive
their
freight
from
the
upper
windows
Mothers
scream
to
their
children
not
to
swing
on
the
garden
gate
for
fear
they
may
be
drowned
Water
roads
are
more
frequent
in
Holland
than
common
roads
and
railroads
water
fences
in
the
form
of
lazy
green
ditches
enclose
pleasure
ground
farm
and
garden
Sometimes
fine
green
hedges
are
seen
but
wooden
fences
such
as
we
have
are
rarely
met
with
in
Holland
As
for
stone
fences
a
Hollander
would
lift
his
hands
with
astonishment
at
the
very
idea
There
is
no
stone
there
excepting
those
great
masses
of
rock
that
have
been
brought
from
other
lands
to
strengthen
and
protect
the
coast
All
the
small
stones
or
pebbles
if
there
ever
were
any
seem
to
be
imprisoned
in
pavements
or
quite
melted
away
Boys
with
strong
quick
arms
may
grow
from
aprons
to
full
beards
without
ever
finding
one
to
start
the
water
rings
or
set
the
rabbits
flying
The
water
roads
are
nothing
less
than
canals
crossing
the
country
in
every
direction
These
are
of
all
sizes
from
the
great
North
Holland
Ship
Canal
which
is
the
wonder
of
the
world
to
those
which
a
boy
can
leap
Water
omnibuses
constantly
ply
up
and
down
these
roads
for
the
conveyance
of
passengers
and
water
drays
are
used
for
carrying
fuel
and
merchandise
Illustration
Instead
of
green
country
lanes
green
canals
stretch
from
field
to
barn
and
from
barn
to
garden
and
the
farms
are
merely
great
lakes
pumped
dry
Some
of
the
busiest
streets
are
water
while
many
of
the
country
roads
are
paved
with
brick
The
city
boats
with
their
rounded
sterns
gilded
bows
and
gayly
painted
sides
are
unlike
any
others
under
the
sun
a
Dutch
waggon
with
its
funny
little
crooked
pole
is
a
perfect
mystery
of
mysteries
One
thing
is
clear
you
may
think
that
the
inhabitants
need
never
be
thirsty
But
no
Odd
land
is
true
to
itself
still
With
the
sea
pushing
to
get
in
and
the
lakes
struggling
to
get
out
and
the
overflowing
canals
rivers
and
ditches
in
many
districts
there
is
no
water
that
is
fit
to
swallow
Our
poor
Hollanders
must
go
dry
or
send
far
inland
for
that
precious
fluid
older
than
Adam
yet
young
as
the
morning
dew
Sometimes
indeed
the
inhabitants
can
swallow
a
shower
when
they
are
provided
with
any
means
of
catching
it
but
generally
they
are
like
the
sailors
told
of
in
a
famous
poem
who
saw
Water
water
everywhere
Nor
any
drop
to
drink
Great
flapping
windmills
all
over
the
country
make
it
look
as
if
flocks
of
huge
sea
birds
were
just
settling
upon
it
Everywhere
one
sees
the
funniest
trees
bobbed
into
all
sorts
of
odd
shapes
with
their
trunks
painted
a
dazzling
white
yellow
or
red
Horses
are
often
yoked
three
abreast
Men
women
and
children
go
clattering
about
in
wooden
shoes
with
loose
heels
Husbands
and
wives
lovingly
harness
themselves
side

on
the

The

I
shall
not

He
maketh
me
to

He
leadeth

He
restoreth

He
leadeth

Yea

I

Thy

Thou
preparest

In

Thou
anointest

runneth

THE
HEROIC
SERF
In
the
dark
forests
of
Russia
where
the
snow
lies
on
the
ground
for
eight
months
in
the
year
wolves
roam
about
in
countless
troops
and
it
is
a
fearful
thing
for
the
traveller
especially
if
night
overtakes
him
to
hear
their
famished
howlings
as
they
approach
nearer
and
nearer
to
him
A
Russian
nobleman
with
his
wife
and
a
young
daughter
was
travelling
in
a
sleigh
over
a
bleak
plain
About
nightfall
they
reached
an
inn
and
the
nobleman
called
for
a
relay
of
horses
to
go
on
The
innkeeper
begged
him
not
to
proceed
There
is
danger
ahead
said
he
the
wolves
are
out
The
traveller
thought
the
object
of
the
man
was
to
keep
him
as
a
guest
for
the
night
and
saying
it
was
too
early
in
the
season
for
wolves
ordered
the
horses
to
be
put
to
In
spite
of
the
repeated
warnings
of
the
landlord
the
party
proceeded
on
their
way
The
driver
was
a
serf
who
had
been
born
on
the
nobleman
s
estate
and
who
loved
his
master
as
he
loved
his
life
The
sleigh
sped
swiftly
over
the
hard
snow
and
there
seemed
no
signs
of
danger
The
moon
began
to
shed
her
light
so
that
the
road
seemed
like
polished
silver
Suddenly
the
little
girl
said
to
her
father
What
is
that
strange
dull
sound
I
heard
just
now
Her
father
replied
Nothing
but
the
wind
sighing
through
the
trees
The
child
shut
her
eyes
and
kept
still
for
a
while
but
in
a
few
minutes
with
a
face
pale
with
fear
she
turned
to
her
father
and
said
Surely
that
is
not
the
wind
I
hear
it
again
do
you
not
hear
it
too
Listen
The
nobleman
listened
and
far
far
away
in
the
distance
behind
him
but
distinct
enough
in
the
clear
frosty
air
he
heard
a
sound
of
which
he
knew
the
meaning
though
those
who
were
with
him
did
not
Whispering
to
the
serf
he
said
They
are
after
us
Get
ready
your
musket
and
pistols
I
will
do
the
same
We
may
yet
escape
Drive
on
drive
on
The
man
drove
wildly
on
but
nearer
ever
nearer
came
the
mournful
howling
which
the
child
had
first
heard
It
was
perfectly
clear
to
the
nobleman
that
a
pack
of
wolves
had
got
scent
and
was
in
pursuit
of
them
Meanwhile
he
tried
to
calm
the
anxious
fears
of
his
wife
and
child
At
last
the
baying
of
the
wolves
was
distinctly
heard
and
he
said
to
his
servant
When
they
come
up
with
us
single
you
out
the
leader
and
fire
I
will
single
out
the
next
and
as
soon
as
one
falls
the
rest
will
stop
to
devour
him
That
will
be
some
delay
at
least
By
this
time
they
could
see
the
pack
fast
approaching
with
their
long
measured
tread
A
large
dog
wolf
was
the
leader
The
nobleman
and
the
serf
singled
out
two
and
these
fell
The
pack
immediately
turned
on
their
fallen
comrades
and
soon
tore
them
to
pieces
The
taste
of
blood
only
made
the
others
advance
with
more
fury
and
they
were
soon
again
baying
at
the
sleigh
Again
the
nobleman
and
his
servant
fired
Two
other
wolves
fell
and
were
instantly
devoured
But
the
next
post
house
was
still
far
distant
The
nobleman
then
cried
to
the
post
boy
Let
one
of
the
horses
loose
that
we
may
gain
a
little
more
time
This
was
done
and
the
horse
was
left
on
the
road
In
a
few
minutes
they
heard
the
loud
shrieks
of
the
poor
animal
as
the
wolves
tore
him
down
The
remaining
horses
were
urged
to
their
utmost
speed
but
again
the
pack
was
in
full
pursuit
Another
horse
was
cut
loose
and
he
soon
shared
the
fate
of
his
fellow
At
length
the
servant
said
to
his
master
I
have
served
you
since
I
was
a
child
and
I
love
you
as
I
love
my
own
life
It
is
clear
to
me
that
we
can
not
all
reach
the
post
house
alive
I
am
quite
prepared
and
I
ask
you
to
let
me
die
for
you
No
no
cried
the
master
we
will
live
together
or
die
together
You
must
not
must
not
But
the
servant
had
made
up
his
mind
he
was
fully
resolved
I
shall
leave
my
wife
and
children
to
you
you
will
be
a
father
to
them
you
have
been
a
father
to
me
When
the
wolves
next
reach
us
I
will
jump
down
and
do
my
best
to
delay
their
progress
Illustration
The
sleigh
glides
on
as
fast
as
the
two
remaining
horses
can
drag
it
The
wolves
are
close
on
their
track
and
almost
up
with
them
But
what
sound
now
rings
out
sharp
and
loud
It
is
the
discharge
of
the
servant
s
pistol
At
the
same
instant
he
leaps
from
his
seat
and
falls
a
prey
to
the
wolves
But
meanwhile
the
post
house
is
reached
and
the
family
is
safe
On
the
spot
where
the
wolves
had
pulled
to
pieces
the
devoted
servant
there
now
stands
a
large
wooden
cross
erected
by
the
nobleman
It
bears
this
inscription
Greater
love
hath
no
man
than
this
that
a
man
lay
down
his
life
for

THE
OTTER
Illustration
The
otter
resembles
land
animals
in
shape
hair
and
general
conformation
and
the
aquatic
tribes
in
its
manner
of
living
and
in
its
webbed
toes
which
assist
it
in
swimming
It
swims
even
faster
than
it
runs
and
can
overtake
fishes
in
their
own
element
It
is
found
in
all
parts
of
the
world
on
tropical
islands
in
America
and
on
the
bleak
coasts
of
Alaska
and
Siberia
It
is
one
of
the
great
weasel
family
as
active
and
cunning
in
the
water
as
its
land
relations
are
in
the
field
or
in
the
farm
yard
The
fish
otter
which
is
found
around
lakes
and
rivers
in
Canada
in
the
United
States
in
South
America
and
in
wild
parts
of
Europe
is
a
famous
fisher
Its
home
is
in
the
water
but
it
can
travel
over
the
land
with
wonderful
swiftness
although
its
paws
are
webbed
It
is
very
fond
of
sliding
down
hill
On
the
slopes
by
ponds
and
rivers
it
enjoys
itself
in
a
very
odd
fashion
It
lies
with
its
fore
feet
bent
backward
and
pushes
itself
forward
with
its
hind
feet
going
down
the
snowy
or
muddy
slope
with
as
much
pleasure
as
if
it
were
a
schoolboy
coasting
A
number
of
fish
otters
thus
amusing
themselves
must
present
a
very
ludicrous
sight
These
furry
little
quadrupeds
can
stay
a
long
time
under
water
swimming
swiftly
and
without
noise
so
that
the
fish
they
follow
seldom
escape
them
If
the
prey
is
small
the
otters
do
not
trouble
themselves
to
go
far
with
it
but
bite
off
the
most
delicate
morsels
and
throw
the
rest
away
When
they
catch
a
large
fish
however
they
drag
it
ashore
and
feed
upon
it
at
their
leisure
When
fish
are
not
plentiful
enough
the
otters
grown
bold
from
necessity
will
attack
ducks
or
any
other
waterfowl
within
reach
They
are
so
strong
and
bite
so
fiercely
that
the
animals
they
pursue
may
well
regard
them
with
terror
Their
habitations
are
really
safe
hiding
places
They
burrow
under
the
ground
and
make
the
entrance
of
their
nest
under
water
so
that
no
land
enemies
can
pursue
them
certainly
no
water
foe
can
follow
them
into
the
hollow
made
by
them
in
the
bank
This
proves
that
the
crafty
nature
of
the
weasel
is
not
wanting
in
the
otter
They
dig
upward
four
or
five
feet
or
even
more
and
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
they
make
a
little
room
which
they
line
with
moss
and
grass
for
the
comfort
of
the
baby
otters
This
underground
room
has
no
need
of
windows
but
it
does
need
ventilation
and
a
minute
air
hole
leading
like
a
chimney
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
is
an
important
part
of
otter
house
building
When
taken
young
otters
can
be
tamed
and
taught
to
catch
fish
for
their
masters
being
trained
to
hunt
as
dogs
are
trained
for
the
chase
I
have
seen
one
says
Goldsmith
go
to
a
gentleman
s
pond
at
the
word
of
command
drive
up
the
fish
into
a
corner
and
having
seized
upon
the
largest
bring
it
off
in
its
mouth
to
its
master
Otters
differ
very
much
in
size
and
color
Fish
otters
are
from
two
to
three
feet
long
and
sea
otters
the
largest
of
the
family
are
somewhat
longer
These
sea
otters
are
very
much
prized
for
their
soft

Some
of
the
species
however
are
white
with
a

others

XXXVI
A
CHILD
S
DREAM
OF
A
STAR
CHARLES
DICKENS
There
was
once
a
child
and
he
strolled
about
a
good
deal
and
thought
of
a
number
of
things
He
had
a
sister
who
was
a
child
too
and
his
constant
companion
These
two
used
to
wonder
all
day
long
They
wondered
at
the
beauty
of
the
flowers
they
wondered
at
the
height
and
blueness
of
the
sky
they
wondered
at
the
goodness
and
the
power
of
God
who
made
the
lovely
world
They
used
to
say
to
one
another
sometimes
Supposing
all
the
children
upon
earth
were
to
die
would
the
flowers
and
the
water
and
the
sky
be
sorry
They
believed
they
would
be
sorry
For
said
they
the
buds
are
the
children
of
the
flowers
and
the
little
playful
streams
that
gambol
down
the
hillsides
are
the
children
of
the
water
and
the
smallest
bright
specks
playing
at
hide
and
seek
in
the
sky
all
night
must
surely
be
the
children
of
the
stars
and
they
would
all
be
grieved
to
see
their
playmates
the
children
of
men
no
more
There
was
one
clear
shining
star
that
used
to
come
out
in
the
sky
before
the
rest
near
the
church
spire
above
the
graves
It
was
larger
and
more
beautiful
they
thought
than
all
the
others
and
every
night
they
watched
for
it
standing
hand
in
hand
at
a
window
Whoever
saw
it
first
cried
out
I
see
the
star
And
often
they
cried
out
both
together
knowing
so
well
when
it
would
rise
and
where
So
they
grew
to
be
such
friends
with
it
that
before
lying
down
on
their
beds
they
always
looked
out
once
again
to
bid
it
good
night
and
when
they
were
turning
round
to
sleep
they
used
to
say
God
bless
the
star
But
while
she
was
still
very
young
oh
very
very
young
the
sister
drooped
and
came
to
be
so
weak
that
she
could
no
longer
stand
at
the
window
at
night
and
then
the
child
looked
sadly
out
by
himself
and
when
he
saw
the
star
turned
round
and
said
to
the
patient
pale
face
on
the
bed
I
see
the
star
and
then
a
smile
would
come
upon
the
face
and
a
little
weak
voice
used
to
say
God
bless
my
brother
and
the
star
And
so
the
time
came
all
too
soon
when
the
child
looked
out
alone
and
when
there
was
no
face
on
the
bed
and
when
there
was
a
little
grave
among
the
graves
not
there
before
and
when
the
star
made
long
rays
down
towards
him
as
he
saw
it
through
his
tears
Now
these
rays
were
so
bright
and
they
seemed
to
make
such
a
shining
way
from
earth
to
heaven
that
when
the
child
went
to
his
solitary
bed
he
dreamed
about
the
star
and
dreamed
that
lying
where
he
was
he
saw
a
train
of
people
taken
up
that
sparkling
road
by
angels
And
the
star
opening
showed
him
a
great
world
of
light
where
many
more
such
angels
waited
to
receive
him
All
these
angels
who
were
waiting
turned
their
beaming
eyes
upon
the
people
who
were
carried
up
into
the
star
and
some
came
out
from
the
long
rows
in
which
they
stood
and
fell
upon
the
people
s
necks
and
kissed
them
tenderly
and
went
away
with
them
down
avenues
of
light
and
were
so
happy
in
their
company
that
lying
in
his
bed
he
wept
for
joy
But
there
were
many
angels
who
did
not
go
with
them
and
among
them
one
he
knew
The
patient
face
that
once
had
lain
upon
the
bed
was
glorified
and
radiant
but
his
heart
found
out
his
sister
among
all
the
host
His
sister
s
angel
lingered
near
the
entrance
of
the
star
and
said
to
the
leader
among
those
who
had
brought
the
people
thither
Is
my
brother
come
And
he
said
No
She
was
turning
hopefully
away
when
the
child
stretched
out
his
arms
and
cried
O
sister
I
am
here
Take
me
And
then
she
turned
her
beaming
eyes
upon
him
and
it
was
night
and
the
star
was
shining
into
the
room
making
long
rays
down
towards
him
as
he
saw
it
through
his
tears
From
that
hour
forth
the
child
looked
out
upon
the
star
as
on
the
Home
he
was
to
go
to
when
his
time
should
come
and
he
thought
that
he
did
not
belong
to
the
earth
alone
but
to
the
star
too
because
of
his
sister
s
angel
gone
before
There
was
a
baby
born
to
be
a
brother
to
the
child
and
while
he
was
so
little
that
he
never
yet
had
spoken
a
word
he
stretched
his
tiny
form
out
on
the
bed
and
died
Again
the
child
dreamed
of
the
opened
star
and
of
the
company
of
angels
and
the
train
of
people
and
the
rows
of
angels
with
their
beaming
eyes
all
turned
upon
those
people
s
faces
Said
his
sister
s
angel
to
the
leader
Is
my
brother
come
And
he
said
Not
that
one
but
another
As
the
child
beheld
his
brother
s
angel
in
her
arms
he
cried
O
sister
I
am
here
Take
me
And
she
turned
and
smiled
upon
him
and
the
star
was
shining
He
grew
to
be
a
young
man
and
was
busy
at
his
books
when
an
old
servant
came
to
him
and
said
Thy
mother
is
no
more
I
bring
her
blessing
on
her
darling
son
Again
at
night
he
saw
the
star
and
all
the
former
company
Said
his
sister
s
angel
to
the
leader
Is
my
brother
come
And
he
said
Thy
mother
A
mighty
cry
of
joy
went
forth
through
all
the
star
because
the
mother
was
reunited
to
her
two
children
And
he
stretched
out
his
arms
and
cried
O
mother
sister
and
brother
I
am
here
Take
me
And
they
answered
him
Not
yet
and
the
star
was
shining
He
grew
to
be
a
man
whose
hair
was
turning
gray
and
he
was
sitting
in
his
chair
by
the
fireside
heavy
with
grief
and
with
his
face
bedewed
with
tears
when
the
star
opened
once
again
Said
his
sister
s
angel
to
the
leader
Is
my
brother
come
And
he
said
Nay
but
his
maiden
daughter
And
the
man
who
had
been
the
child
saw
his
daughter
newly
lost
to
him
a
celestial
creature
among
those
three
and
he
said
My
daughter
s
head
is
on
my
sister
s
bosom
and
her
arm
is
round
my
mother
s
neck
and
at
her
feet
there
is
the
baby
of
old
time
and
I
can
bear
the
parting
from
her
God
be
praised
And
the
star
was
shining
Thus
the
child
came
to
be
an
old
man
and
his
face
was
wrinkled
and
his
steps
were
slow
and
his
back
was
bent
And
one
night
as
he
lay
upon
his
bed
his
children
standing
around
he
cried
as
he
had
cried
so
long
ago
I
see
the
star
They
whispered
to
one
another
He
is
dying
And
he
said
I
am
My
age
is
falling
from
me
like
a
garment
and
I
move
towards
the
star
as
a
child
And
O
my
Father
now
I
thank
Thee
that
it
has
so
often
opened
to
receive
those
dear
ones
who
await
me
And
the
star
was
shining
and
it
shines
upon
his
grave

XXXIX
THE
BEAVER
There
are
few
animals
that
can
teach
us
more
useful
lessons
than
the
beaver
Illustration
They
are
very
timid
animals
If
we
went
to
places
where
they
are
common
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
find
them
and
see
what
they
do
The
beaver
is
between
two
and
three
feet
long
and
one
foot
high
and
is
covered
with
brown
hair
Its
eyes
are
very
small
and
far
apart
its
ears
also
are
small
and
its
nose
blunt
It
has
very
strong
sharp
teeth
and
a
long
tail
shaped
somewhat
like
the
blade
of
an
oar
This
tail
has
no
hair
or
fur
on
it
but
is
covered
with
little
scales
like
those
of
a
fish
The
hind
feet
of
the
beaver
have
a
thin
skin
between
the
toes
This
shows
that
the
beaver
is
fitted
for
swimming
During
the
summer
these
animals
live
in
holes
near
the
banks
of
rivers
They
are
very
social
animals
They
never
live
alone
They
usually
go
in
parties
and
build
a
little
beaver
town
They
have
some
means
of
making
known
their
wants
to
each
other
They
know
they
will
be
safer
in
water
than
on
land
so
they
try
to
find
a
pond
where
they
can
build
their
town
If
they
can
not
do
this
they
will
choose
a
running
stream
with
some
trees
on
the
banks
The
first
thing
they
do
is
to
make
a
dam
right
across
the
stream
They
have
neither
saws
nor
hatchets
with
which
to
cut
down
the
trees
but
they
use
their
sharp
strong
teeth
and
gnaw
and
gnaw
away
until
they
bring
down
tree
after
tree
These
little
wood
cutters
know
very
well
how
to
do
this
otherwise
the
trees
might
fall
and
kill
them
When
they
have
gnawed
nearly
through
the
trunk
away
they
run
to
see
if
the
tree
is
beginning
to
bend
If
it
is
still
straight
they
set
to
work
again
but
the
moment
they
hear
it
crack
off
they
run
to
keep
out
of
danger
When
the
tree
is
down
they
gnaw
off
all
the
branches
in
the
same
way
and
then
cut
the
trunk
into
short
pieces
and
roll
them
down
to
the
water
s
edge
Then
they
go
to
work
at
another
tree
and
still
another
until
they
have
cut
down
all
they
want
These
logs
of
wood
kept
in
their
places
by
mud
and
stones
make
a
dam
and
this
dam
stops
the
water
and
causes
it
to
rise
around
their
houses
and
cover
the
openings
which
are
at
the
bottom
and
helps
to
keep
them
safe
from
danger
Then
the
houses
are
built
of
mud
stones
sticks
and
small
branches
twined
in
and
out
to
keep
them
fast
These
houses
are
several
feet
high
and
are
very
thick
There
are
two
rooms
in
them
one
at
the
bottom
under
water
which
they
use
for
a
store
room
and
the
other
at
the
top
above
the
water
for
a
living
room
The
floor
of
this
room
is
covered
with
soft
moss
But
these
wise
beavers
know
that
they
must
have
a
store
of
food
for
the
winter
as
well
as
a
snug
little
house
to
live
in
They
gather
logs
of
wood
and
branches
and
put
them
away
in
their
store
room
The
bark
of
these
logs
and
some
water
plants
supply
them
with
food
When
they
are
at
home
during
the
winter
months
in
their
beaver
town
they
always
have
a
sentinel
to
keep
watch
and
if
any
one
comes
near
he
gives
the
alarm
by
striking
the
water
with
his
broad
flat
tail
There
are
no
idle
beavers
They
not
only
work
hard
but
with
great
skill
and
care

Where
they

XL
THE
ANGEL
S
WHISPER
SAMUEL
LOVER
A
superstition
of
great
beauty
prevails
in
Ireland
that
when
a
child
smiles
in
its
sleep
it
is
talking
with
angels
LOVER
A
baby
was
sleeping
Its
mother
was
weeping
For
her
husband
was
far
on
the
wild
raging
sea
And
the
tempest
was
swelling
Round
the
fisherman
s
dwelling
And
she
cried
Dermot
darling
oh
come
back
to
me
Her
beads
while
she
numbered
The
baby
still
slumbered
And
smiled
in
her
face
as
she
bended
her
knee
Oh
blessed
be
that
warning
My
child
thy
sleep
adorning
For
I
know
that
the
angels
are
whispering
with
thee
And
while
they
are
keeping
Bright
watch
o
er
thy
sleeping
Oh
pray
to
them
softly
my
baby
with

And
say
thou
would

rather
They

For
I
know
that
the

are
whispering
with

The
dawn
of

morning
Saw
Dermot
returning
And
the
wife
wept
with
joy
her
babe

father
to
see
And
closely
caressing
Her

THE
RAPID
CHARLES
SANGSTER
All
peacefully
gliding
the
waters
dividing
The
indolent
batteau
moved
slowly
along
The
rowers
light
hearted
from
sorrow
long
parted
Beguiled
the
dull
moments
with
laughter
and
song
Hurrah
for
the
Rapid
that
merrily
merrily
Gambols
and
leaps
on
its
tortuous
way
Soon
we
will
enter
it
cheerily
cheerily
Pleased
with
its
freshness
and
wet
with
its
spray
More
swiftly
careering
the
wild
Rapid
nearing
They
dash
down
the
stream
like
a
terrified
steed
The
surges
delight
them
no
terrors
affright
them
Their
voices
keep
pace
with
their
quickening
speed
Hurrah
for
the
Rapid
that
merrily
merrily
Shivers
its
arrows
against
us
in
play
Now
we
have
entered
it
cheerily
cheerily
Our
spirits
as
light
as
its
feathery
spray
Fast
downward
they
re
dashing
each
fearless
eye
flashing
Though
danger
awaits
them
on
every
side
Yon
rock
see
it
frowning
they
strike
they
are
drowning
But
downward
they
speed
with
the
merciless
tide
No
voice
cheers
the
Rapid
that
angrily
angrily
Shivers
their
bark
in
its
maddening
play
Gaily
they
entered
it
heedlessly
recklessly
Mingling
their
lives
with
its
treacherous
spray
XLII
A
NARROW
ESCAPE
In
Livingstone
the
celebrated
traveller
settled
as
a
missionary
in
Mabtosa
a
beautiful
valley
in
South
Africa
Here
he
met
with
an
adventure
which
nearly
terminated
his
earthly
career
The
natives
of
Mabtosa
had
long
been
troubled
by
lions
which
invaded
their
cattle
pens
by
night
and
even
attacked
the
herds
during
the
day
These
poor
people
being
very
ignorant
and
superstitious
thought
that
the
inroads
of
the
lions
were
caused
by
witchcraft
It
was
perhaps
for
this
reason
that
all
their
attempts
to
drive
away
the
animals
were
feeble
and
faint
hearted
and
therefore
unsuccessful
It
is
well
known
that
a
troop
of
lions
will
not
remain
long
in
any
district
where
one
of
their
number
has
been
killed
So
the
next
time
the
herds
of
Mabtosa
were
attacked
Livingstone
went
out
with
the
natives
to
encourage
them
to
destroy
one
of
the
marauders
and
thus
free
themselves
from
the
whole
troop
They
found
the
lions
on
a
small
hill
covered
with
wood
The
hunters
placed
themselves
in
a
circle
round
the
hill
and
began
to
ascend
coming
gradually
closer
to
each
other
as
they
approached
the
summit
Livingstone
remained
along
with
a
native
teacher
on
the
plain
below
to
watch
the
man
uvres
of
the
party
His
companion
seeing
one
of
the
lions
sitting
on
a
piece
of
rock
within
the
circle
of
hunters
took
aim
and
fired
but
the
ball
only
struck
the
stones
at
the
animal
s
feet
With
a
roar
of
rage
the
fierce
brute
bounded
away
broke
through
the
ring
and
escaped
unhurt
the
natives
not
having
the
courage
to
stand
close
and
spear
him
as
he
passed
The
band
again
closed
in
and
resumed
their
march
There
were
still
two
lions
in
the
wood
and
it
was
hoped
that
fortune
would
favor
a
second
attempt
to
destroy
one
of
them
But
suddenly
a
terrific
roar
echoed
from
the
hill
and
the
timid
hunters
quaked
with
fear
First
one
of
the
lions
and
then
the
other
with
streaming
manes
and
glaring
eyes
rushed
down
through
the
wavering
ranks
and
bounded
away
free
to
continue
their
devastations
As
the
party
were
returning
home
bewailing
their
want
of
success
Livingstone
observed
one
of
the
lions
about
thirty
yards
in
front
sitting
on
a
rock
behind
a
bush
Raising
his
gun
he
took
steady
aim
and
discharged
both
barrels
into
the
thicket
He
is
shot
He
is
shot
was
the
joyful
cry
and
some
of
the
men
were
about
to
rush
in
and
despatch
the
wounded
beast
with
their
spears
But
Livingstone
seeing
the
lion
s
tail
erected
in
anger
warned
them
to
keep
back
until
he
had
fired
a
second
time
He
was
just
in
the
act
of
reloading
when
hearing
a
shout
of
terror
he
looked
round
and
saw
the
lion
preparing
to
spring
It
was
too
late
to
retreat
With
a
savage
growl
the
frenzied
animal
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
and
shook
him
as
a
terrier
shakes
a
rat
The
shock
caused
a
momentary
anguish
followed
by
a
sort
of
drowsiness
in
which
he
had
no
sense
of
pain
nor
feeling
of
terror
though
he
knew
all
that
was
happening
Illustration
The
lion
s
paw
was
resting
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
as
he
turned
round
to
relieve
himself
of
the
pressure
he
saw
the
creature
s
fiery
eyes
directed
to
the
native
teacher
who
at
a
distance
of
ten
or
fifteen
yards
was
making
ready
to
shoot
The
gun
missed
fire
in
both
barrels
and
the
lion
sprang
at
his
new
assailant
and
bit
him
in
the
thigh
Another
man
also
who
was
standing
near
was
severely
bitten
in
the
shoulder
but
at
this
moment
the
bullets
took
effect
and
the
huge
beast
fell
back
dead
All
this
occurred
in
a
few
seconds
the
death
blow
had
been
inflicted
before
the
animal
sprang
upon
his
assailants
Livingstone
s
arm
was
wounded
in
eleven
places
and
the
bone
crushed
into
splinters
and
the
injuries
might
have
proved
fatal
but
for
his
tartan
jacket
which
wiped
the
poison
from
the
lion
s
teeth
before
they
entered
the
flesh
It
was
long
ere
the
wounds
healed
and
all
through
life
the
intrepid
missionary
bore
the
marks
of
this
dreadful
encounter
Thirty
years
afterwards
when
his
noble
and
useful
career
had
ended
among
the
swamps
of
Central
Africa
and
his
remains
were
taken
to
England
to
be
interred
in
Westminster
Abbey
the
crushed
and
mangled
arm
was
one
of
the
marks
which
enabled
his
sorrowing
friends
in
that
country
to
identify
the

THE
FAIRIES
OF
CALDON
LOW
A
MIDSUMMER
LEGEND
MARY
HOWITT
Illustration
And
where
have
you
been
my
Mary
And
where
have
you
been
from
me
I
ve
been
to
the
top
of
the
Caldon
Low
The
Midsummer
night
to
see
And
what
did
you
see
my
Mary
All
up
on
the
Caldon
Low
I
saw
the
blithe
sunshine
come
down
And
I
saw
the
merry
winds
blow
And
what
did
you
hear
my
Mary
All
up
on
the
Caldon
Hill
I
heard
the
drops
of
the
water
made
And
the
green
corn
ears
to
fill
Oh
tell
me
all
my
Mary
All
all
that
ever
you
know
For
you
must
have
seen
the
fairies
Last
night
on
the
Caldon
Low
Then
take
me
on
your
knee
mother
And
listen
mother
of
mine
A
hundred
fairies
danced
last
night
And
the
harpers
they
were
nine
And
merry
was
the
glee
of
the
harp
strings
And
their
dancing
feet
so
small
But
oh
the
sound
of
their
talking
Was
merrier
far
than
all
And
what
were
the
words
my
Mary
That
you
did
hear
them
say
I
ll
tell
you
all
my
mother
But
let
me
have
my
way
And
some
they
played
with
the
water
And
rolled
it
down
the
hill
And
this
they
said
shall
speedily
turn
The
poor
old
miller
s
mill
For
there
has
been
no
water
Ever
since
the
first
of
May
And
a
busy
man
shall
the
miller
be
By
the
dawning
of
the
day
Oh
the
miller
how
he
will
laugh
When
he
sees
the
mill
dam
rise
The
jolly
old
miller
how
he
will
laugh
Till
the
tears
fill
both
his
eyes
And
some
they
seized
the
little
winds
That
sounded
over
the
hill
And
each
put
a
horn
into
his
mouth
And
blew
so
sharp
and
shrill
And
there
said
they
the
merry
winds
go
Away
from
every
horn
And
those
shall
clear
the
mildew
dank
From
the
blind
old
widow
s
corn
Oh
the
poor
blind
old
widow
Though
she
has
been
blind
so
long
She
ll
be
merry
enough
when
the
mildew
s
gone
And
the
corn
stands
stiff
and
strong
And
some
they
brought
the
brown
lintseed
And
flung
it
down
from
the
Low
And
this
said
they
by
the
sunrise
In
the
weaver
s
croft
shall
grow
Oh
the
poor
lame
weaver
How
he
will
laugh
outright
When
he
sees
his
dwindling
flax
field
All
full
of
flowers
by
night
And
then
upspoke
a
brownie
With
a
long
beard
on
his
chin
I
have
spun
up
all
the
tow
said
he
And
I
want
some
more
to
spin
I
ve
spun
a
piece
of
hempen
cloth
And
I
want
to
spin
another
A
little
sheet
for
Mary
s
bed
And
an
apron
for
her
mother
And
with
that
I
could
not
help
but
laugh
And
I
laughed
out
loud
and
free
And
then
on
the
top
of
the
Caldon
Low
There
was
no
one
left
but
me
And
all
on
the
top
of
the
Caldon
Low
The
mists
were
cold
and
gray
And
nothing
I
saw
but
the
mossy
stones
That
round
about
me
lay
But
as
I
came
down
from
the
hill
top
I
heard
afar
below
How
busy
the
jolly
miller
was
And
how
merry
the
wheel
did
go
And
I
peeped
into
the
widow
s
field
And
sure
enough
were
seen
The
yellow
ears
of
the
mildewed
corn
All
standing
stiff
and
green
And
down
by
the
weaver
s
croft
I
stole
To
see
if
the
flax
were
high
But
I
saw
the
weaver
at
his
gate
With
the
good
news
in
his
eye
Now
this
is
all
I
heard
mother
And
all
that
I
did
see
So
prithee
make
my
bed
mother
For
I
m
tired
as
I
can
be
XLIV
VOLCANOES
Illustration
In
various
parts
of
the
earth
there
are
mountains
that
send
out
from
their
highest
peaks
smoke
ashes
and
fire
Mountains
of
this
class
are
called
volcanoes
and
they
present
a
striking
contrast
to
other
mountains
on
account
of
their
conical
form
and
the
character
of
the
rocks
of
which
they
are
composed
All
volcanoes
have
at
their
summits
what
are
called
craters
These
are
large
hollow
circular
openings
from
which
the
smoke
and
fire
escape
Nearly
all
volcanoes
emit
smoke
constantly
This
smoke
proceeds
from
fires
that
are
burning
far
down
in
the
depths
of
the
earth
Sometimes
these
fires
burst
forth
from
the
crater
of
the
volcano
with
tremendous
force
The
smoke
becomes
thick
and
black
and
lurid
flames
shoot
up
to
a
height
of
hundreds
of
feet
making
a
scene
of
amazing
grandeur
With
the
flames
there
are
thrown
out
stones
ashes
and
streams
of
melted
rock
called
lava
This
lava
flows
down
the
sides
of
the
mountain
and
being
red
hot
destroys
everything
with
which
it
comes
in
contact
At
such
times
a
volcano
is
said
to
be
in
eruption
Such
is
the
force
of
some
of
these
eruptions
that
large
rocks
have
been
hurled
to
great
distances
from
the
crater
and
towns
and
cities
have
been
buried
under
a
vast
covering
of
ashes
and
lava
The
quantity
of
lava
and
ashes
which
sometimes
escapes
from
volcanoes
during
an
eruption
is
almost
beyond
comprehension
In
a
volcano
in
the
island
of
Java
threw
out
ashes
and
cinders
that
covered
the
ground
fifty
feet
deep
for
a
distance
of
seven
miles
all
around
the
mountain
This
eruption
destroyed
nearly
forty
towns
and
villages
In
a
volcano
in
Iceland
sent
out
two
streams
of
lava
one
forty
miles
long
and
seven
miles
wide
and
the
other
fifty
miles
long
and
fifteen
miles
wide
These
streams
were
from
one
hundred
to
six
hundred
feet
deep
Near
the
city
of
Naples
in
Italy
is
situated
the
volcano
Mt
Vesuvius
This
fiery
monster
has
probably
caused
more
destruction
than
any
other
volcano
known
In
the
year
A
D
it
suddenly
burst
forth
in
a
violent
eruption
that
resulted
in
one
of
the
most
appalling
disasters
that
ever
happened
Such
immense
quantities
of
ashes
stones
and
lava
were
poured
forth
from
its
crater
that
within
twenty
hours
two
large
cities
were
completely
destroyed
These
cities
were
Herculaneum
and
Pompeii
At
this
eruption
of
Vesuvius
the
stream
of
lava
flowed
directly
through
and
over
the
city
of
Herculaneum
into
the
sea
The
quantity
was
so
great
that
as
it
cooled
and
became
hardened
it
gradually
filled
up
all
the
streets
and
ran
over
the
tops
of
the
houses
While
the
lava
was
thus
turning
the
city
into
a
mass
of
solid
stone
the
inhabitants
were
fleeing
from
it
along
the
shore
toward
Naples
and
in
boats
on
the
sea
At
the
same
time
too
the
wind
carried
the
ashes
and
cinders
in
such
a
direction
as
to
deluge
the
city
of
Pompeii
Slowly
and
steadily
the
immense
volume
of
ashes
and
small
stones
blocked
up
the
streets
and
settled
on
the
roofs
of
the
houses
The
light
of
the
flames
that
burst
out
from
the
awful
crater
aided
the
people
in
their
escape
but
many
who
for
some
reason
could
not
get
away
perished
Pompeii
was
so
completely
covered
that
nothing
could
be
seen
of
it
Thus
it
remained
buried
under
the
ground
until
the
year
when
it
was
discovered
by
accident
Since
that
time
much
of
the
city
has
been
uncovered
and
now
one
can
walk
along
the
streets
look
into
the
houses
and
form
some
idea
how
the
people
lived
there
eighteen
hundred
years
ago

XLVI
CURIOUS
BIRDS
NESTS
Among
the
most
curious
nests
are
those
made
by
the
birds
called
weavers
These
feathered
workmen
serve
no
apprenticeship
their
trade
comes
to
them
by
nature
and
how
well
they
work
at
it
But
then
you
must
admit
that
Nature
is
a
skilful
teacher
and
birds
are
apt
scholars
The
Baltimore
oriole
is
a
weaver
and
it
makes
its
nest
out
of
bark
fine
grass
moss
and
wool
strengthening
it
when
circumstances
permit
with
pieces
of
string
or
horsehair
This
nest
pouch
shaped
and
open
at
the
top
is
fastened
to
the
branch
of
a
tree
and
is
sometimes
interwoven
with
the
twigs
of
a
waving
bough
The
threads
of
grass
and
long
fibres
of
moss
are
woven
together
in
and
out
as
if
by
machinery
and
it
seems
hard
to
believe
that
the
little
birds
can
do
such
work
without
help
The
long
slender
boughs
of
the
willow
are
the
favorite
resort
of
the
oriole
and
here
in
the
midst
of
a
storm
the
bird
may
sit
in
its
swinging
nest
fearing
no
danger
What
is
there
to
dread
The
trees
rock
in
the
wind
but
the
oriole
s
habitation
is
strong
and
well
secured
Unless
the
branch
from
which
the
nest
hangs
be
torn
from
the
tree
the
nest
will
endure
the
tempest
and
prove
a
safe
shelter
for
the
blithe
little
bird
Many
weaver
birds
in
Asia
and
Africa
hang
their
nests
from
the
ends
of
twigs
and
branches
overhanging
the
water
This
is
to
keep
away
monkeys
and
snakes
which
abound
in
hot
countries
and
are
the
greatest
enemies
birds
have
The
wise
little
weaver
knows
that
the
cunning
monkey
will
not
trust
his
precious
life
to
a
frail
branch
that
may
break
and
drop
him
into
the
water
yet
the
same
frail
branch
is
strong
enough
for
the
bird
and
its
nest
In
this
case
the
monkey
is
obliged
to
admit
that
the
bird
s
wisdom
is
more
than
a
match
for
his
Illustration
A
very
curious
custom
exists
among
a
class
of
birds
found
in
Africa
called
the
social
weavers
They
begin
their
work
in
companies
and
build
immense
canopies
like
umbrellas
in
the
tops
of
trees
These
grassy
structures
are
so
closely
woven
that
the
rain
cannot
penetrate
them
Under
this
shelter
the
birds
build
their
nests
but
no
longer
in
company
the
nest
for
each
pair
must
be
made
by
the
pair
without
assistance
from
their
neighbors
The
tailor
bird
of
India
makes
a
still
more
curious
nest
than
that
of
the
weavers
it
actually
sews
using
its
long
slender
bill
as
a
needle
Birds
that
fly
birds
that
run
birds
that
swim
and
birds
that
sing
are
by
no
means
rare
but
birds
that
sew
seem
like
the
wonderful
birds
in
the
fairy
tales
Yet
they
really
exist
and
make
their
odd
nests
with
great
care
and
skill
They
pick
out
a
leaf
large
enough
for
their
nest
and
pierce
rows
of
holes
along
the
edges
with
their
sharp
bill
then
with
the
fibres
of
a
plant
or
long
threads
of
grass
they
sew
the
leaf
up
into
a
bag
Sometimes
it
is
necessary
to
sew
two
leaves
together
that
the
space
within
may
be
large
enough
This
kind
of
sewing
resembles
shoemakers
or
saddlers
work
but
the
leaf
being
like
fine
cloth
and
not
like
leather
perhaps
the
name
tailor
bird
is
the
most
appropriate
for
the
little
worker
The
bag
is
lined
with
soft
downy
material
and
in
this
the
tiny
eggs
are
laid
tiny
indeed
for
the
tailor
bird
is
no
larger
than
the
humming
bird
The
weight
of
the
little
creature
does
not
even
draw
down
the
nest
and
the
leaf
in
which
the
eggs
or
young
birds
are
hidden
looks
like
the
other
leaves
on
the
trees
so
that
there
is
nothing
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
forest
robbers
Another
bird
called
the
Indian
sparrow
makes
her
nest
of
grass
woven
like
cloth
and
shaped
like
a
bottle
The
neck
of
the
bottle
hangs
downward
and
the
bird
enters
from
below
This
structure
swinging
from
a
high
tree
over
a
river
is
safe
from
the
visits
of
mischievous
animals
If
all
the
stories
about
this
Indian
sparrow
are
true
the
inside
of
its
nest
is
strangely
adorned
Fire
flies
are
brought
in
by

XLIX
THE
WHISTLE
BENJAMIN
FRANKLIN
When
I
was
a
child
seven
years
old
my
friends
on
a
holiday
filled
my
pockets
with
coppers
I
went
directly
toward
a
shop
where
they
sold
toys
for
children
and
being
charmed
with
the
sound
of
a
whistle
that
I
met
by
the
way
in
the
hands
of
another
boy
I
voluntarily
offered
him
all
my
money
for
it
I
then
returned
home
and
went
whistling
all
over
the
house
much
pleased
with
my
whistle
but
disturbing
all
the
family
My
brothers
and
sisters
and
cousins
understanding
the
bargain
I
had
made
told
me
I
had
given
four
times
as
much
for
it
as
it
was
worth
This
put
me
in
mind
of
what
good
things
I
might
have
bought
with
the
rest
of
the
money
and
they
laughed
at
me
so
much
for
my
folly
that
I
cried
with
vexation
This
however
was
afterward
of
use
to
me
the
impression
continuing
on
my
mind
so
that
often
when
I
was
tempted
to
buy
some
unnecessary
thing
I
said
to
myself
Don
t
give
too
much
for
the
whistle
and
so
I
saved
my
money
As
I
grew
up
went
into
the
world
and
observed
the
actions
of
men
I
thought
I
met
with
many
very
many
who
gave
too
much
for
their
whistles
When
I
saw
any
one
too
ambitious
of
the
favor
of
the
great
wasting
his
time
in
attendance
on
public
dinners
sacrificing
his
repose
his
liberty
his
virtue
and
perhaps
his
friends
to
retain
it
I
said
to
myself
This
man
gives
too
much
for
his
whistle
When
I
saw
another
fond
of
popularity
constantly
employing
himself
in
politics
neglecting
his
own
affairs
and
ruining
them
by
that
neglect
He
pays
indeed
said
I
too
much
for
his
whistle
If
I
knew
a
miser
who
gave
up
every
kind
of
comfortable
living
all
the
pleasure
of
doing
good
to
others
all
the
esteem
of
his
fellow
citizens
and
the
joys
of
benevolent
friendship
for
the
sake
of
accumulating
wealth
Poor
man
said
I
you
do
indeed
pay
too
much
for
your
whistle
When
I
met
a
man
of
pleasure
sacrificing
the
improvement
of
his
mind
or
of
his
fortune
to
mere
bodily
comfort
Mistaken
man
said
I
you
are
providing
pain
for
yourself
instead
of
pleasure
you
give
too
much
for
your
whistle
If
I
saw
one
fond
of
fine
clothes
fine
furniture
fine
horses
all
above
his
fortune
for
which
he
contracted
debts
and
ended
his
career
in
prison
Alas
said
I
he
has
paid
dear
very
dear
for
his
whistle
In
short
I
believed
that
a
great
part
of
the
miseries
of
mankind
were
brought
upon
them
by
the
false
estimates
they
had
made
of
the
value
of
things
and
by
their
giving
too
much
for
their
whistles

THE

SOUTHEY
Illustration
No
stir
in
the
air
no
stir
in
the
sea
The
ship
was
as
still
as
she
could
be
Her
sails
from
heaven
received
no
motion
Her
keel
was
steady
in
the
ocean
Without
either
sign
or
sound
of
their
shock
The
waves
flowed
over
the
Inchcape
Rock
So
little
they
rose
so
little
they
fell
They
did
not
move
the
Inchcape
Bell
The
pious
Abbot
of
Aberbrothock
Had
placed
that
bell
on
the
Inchcape
Rock
On
a
buoy
in
the
storm
it
floated
and
swung
And
over
the
waves
its
warning
rung
When
the
Rock
was
hid
by
the
surge
s
swell
The
mariners
heard
the
warning
bell
And
then
they
knew
the
perilous
Rock
And
blessed
the
Abbot
of
Aberbrothock
The
sun
in
heaven
was
shining
gay
All
things
were
joyful
on
that
day
The
sea
birds
screamed
as
they
wheeled
round
And
there
was
joyance
in
their
sound
The
buoy
of
the
Inchcape
Bell
was
seen
A
darker
speck
on
the
ocean
green
Sir
Ralph
the
Rover
walked
his
deck
And
he
fixed
his
eye
on
the
darker
speck
He
felt
the
cheering
power
of
spring
It
made
him
whistle
it
made
him
sing
His
heart
was
mirthful
to
excess
But
the
Rover
s
mirth
was
wickedness
His
eye
was
on
the
Inchcape
float
Quoth
he
My
men
put
out
the
boat
And
row
me
to
the
Inchcape
Rock
And
I
ll
plague
the
Abbot
of
Aberbrothock
The
boat
is
lowered
the
boatmen
row
And
to
the
Inchcape
Rock
they
go
Sir
Ralph
bent
over
from
the
boat
And
he
cut
the
bell
from
the
Inchcape
float
Down
sank
the
bell
with
a
gurgling
sound
The
bubbles
rose
and
burst
around
Quoth
Sir
Ralph
The
next
who
comes
to
the
Rock
Won
t
bless
the
Abbot
of
Aberbrothock
Sir
Ralph
the
Rover
sailed
away
He
scoured
the
seas
for
many
a
day
And
now
grown
rich
with
plundered
store
He
steers
his
course
for
Scotland
s
shore
So
thick
a
haze
o
erspreads
the
sky
They
cannot
see
the
sun
on
high
The
wind
hath
blown
a
gale
all
day
At
evening
it
hath
died
away
On
the
deck
the
Rover
takes
his
stand
So
dark
it
is
they
see
no
land
Quoth
Sir
Ralph
It
will
be
lighter
soon
For
there
is
the
dawn
of
the
rising
moon
Canst
hear
said
one
the
breakers
roar
For
methinks
we
should
be
near
the
shore
Now
where
we
are
I
cannot
tell
But
I
wish
we
could
hear
the
Inchcape
Bell
They
hear
no
sound
the
swell
is
strong
Though
the
wind
hath
fallen
they
drift
along
Till
the
vessel
strikes
with
a
shivering
shock
Cried
they
It
is
the
Inchcape
Rock
Sir
Ralph
the
Rover
tore
his
hair
He
cursed
himself
in
his
despair
The
waves
rush
in
on
every
side
The
ship
is
sinking
beneath
the
tide
But
even
in
his
dying
fear
One
dreadful
sound
could
the
Rover
hear
A
sound
as
if
with
the
Inchcape
Bell
The
fiends
below
were
ringing
his
knell
LII
THE
FLAX
HANS
CHRISTIAN
ANDERSEN
The
flax
was
in
full
bloom
it
had
pretty
little
blue
flowers
as
delicate
as
the
wings
of
a
moth
or
even
more
so
The
sun
shone
and
the
showers
watered
it
and
this
was
just
as
good
for
the
flax
as
it
is
for
little
children
to
be
washed
and
then
kissed
by
their
mother
They
look
much
prettier
for
it
and
so
did
the
flax
People
say
that
I
look
exceedingly
well
said
the
flax
and
that
I
am
so
fine
and
long
that
I
shall
make
a
beautiful
piece
of
linen
How
fortunate
I
am
it
makes
me
so
happy
it
is
such
a
pleasant
thing
to
know
that
something
can
be
made
of
me
How
the
sunshine
cheers
me
and
how
sweet
and
refreshing
is
the
rain
my
happiness
overpowers
me
no
one
in
the
world
can
feel
happier
than
I
do
One
day
some
people
came
who
took
hold
of
the
flax
and
pulled
it
up
by
the
roots
this
was
painful
Then
it
was
laid
in
water
as
if
they
intended
to
drown
it
and
after
that
placed
near
a
fire
as
if
it
were
to
be
roasted
all
this
was
very
shocking
We
cannot
expect
to
be
happy
always
said
the
flax
by
experiencing
evil
as
well
as
good
we
become
wise
And
certainly
there
was
plenty
of
evil
in
store
for
the
flax
It
was
steeped
and
roasted
and
broken
and
combed
indeed
it
scarcely
knew
what
was
done
to
it
At
last
it
was
put
on
the
spinning
wheel
Whirr
whirr
went
the
wheel
so
quickly
that
the
flax
could
not
collect
its
thoughts
Well
I
have
been
very
happy
he
thought
in
the
midst
of
his
pain
and
must
be
contented
with
the
past
and
contented
he
remained
till
he
was
put
on
the
loom
and
became
a
beautiful
piece
of
white
linen
All
the
flax
even
to
the
last
stalk
was
used
in
making
this
one
piece
How
wonderful
it
is
that
after
all
I
have
suffered
I
am
made
something
of
at
last
I
am
the
luckiest
person
in
the
world
so
strong
and
fine
and
how
white
and
what
a
length
This
is
something
different
from
being
a
mere
plant
and
bearing
flowers
Then
I
had
no
attention
nor
any
water
unless
it
rained
Now
I
am
watched
and
taken
care
of
Every
morning
the
maid
turns
me
over
and
I
have
a
shower
bath
from
the
watering
pot
every
evening
Yes
and
the
clergyman
s
wife
noticed
me
and
said
I
was
the
best
piece
of
linen
in
the
whole
parish
I
cannot
be
happier
than
I
am
now
After
some
time
the
linen
was
taken
into
the
house
placed
under
the
scissors
and
cut
and
torn
into
pieces
and
then
pricked
with
needles
This
certainly
was
not
pleasant
but
at
last
it
was
made
into
garments
See
now
then
said
the
flax
I
have
become
something
of
importance
This
was
my
destiny
it
is
quite
a
blessing
Now
I
shall
be
of
some
use
in
the
world
as
every
one
ought
to
be
it
is
the
only
way
to
be
happy
Years
passed
away
and
at
last
the
linen
was
so
worn
it
could
scarcely
hold
together
It
must
end
very
soon
said
the
pieces
to
each
other
We
would
gladly
have
held
together
a
little
longer
but
it
is
useless
to
expect
impossibilities
And
at
length
they
fell
into
rags
and
tatters
and
thought
it
was
all
over
with
them
for
they
were
torn
to
shreds
and
steeped
in
water
and
made
into
a
pulp
and
dried
and
they
knew
not
what
besides
till
all
at
once
they
found
themselves
beautiful
white
paper
Well
now
this
is
a
surprise
a
glorious
surprise
too
said
the
paper
I
am
now
finer
than
ever
and
I
shall
be
written
upon
and
who
can
tell
what
fine
things
I
may
have
written
upon
me
This
is
wonderful
luck
And
sure
enough
the
most
beautiful
stories
and
poetry
were
written
upon
it
and
only
once
was
there
a
blot
which
was
very
fortunate
Then
people
heard
the
stories
and
poetry
read
and
it
made
them
wiser
and
better
for
all
that
was
written
had
a
good
and
sensible
meaning
and
a
great
blessing
was
contained
in
the
words
on
the
paper
I
never
imagined
anything
like
this
said
the
paper
when
I
was
only
a
little
blue
flower
growing
in
the
fields
How
could
I
fancy
that
I
should
ever
be
the
means
of
bringing
knowledge
and
joy
to
men
I
cannot
understand
it
myself
and
yet
it
is
really
so
Heaven
knows
that
I
have
done
nothing
myself
but
what
I
was
obliged
to
do
with
my
weak
powers
for
my
own
preservation
and
yet
I
have
been
promoted
from
one
joy
and
honor
to
another
Each
time
I
think
that
the
song
is
ended
and
then
something
higher
and
better
begins
for
me
I
suppose
now
I
shall
be
sent
on
my
travels
about
the
world
so
that
people
may
read
me
It
cannot
be
otherwise
indeed
it
is
more
than
probable
for
I
have
more
splendid
thoughts
written
upon
me
than
I
had
pretty
flowers
in
olden
times
I
am
happier
than
ever
But
the
paper
did
not
go
on
its
travels
It
was
sent
to
the
printer
and
all
the
words
written
upon
it
were
set
up
in
type
to
make
a
book
or
rather
hundreds
of
books
for
so
many
more
persons
could
derive
pleasure
and
profit
from
a
printed
book
than
from
the
written
paper
and
if
the
paper
had
been
sent
about
the
world
it
would
have
been
worn
out
before
it
had
got
half
through
its
journey
This
is
certainly
the
wisest
plan
said
the
written
paper
I
really
did
not
think
of
that
I
shall
remain
at
home
and
be
held
in
honor
like
some
old
grandfather
as
I
really
am
to
all
these
new
books
They
will
do
some
good
I
could
not
have
wandered
about
as
they
do
Yet
he
who
wrote
all
this
has
looked
at
me
as
every
word
flowed
from
his
pen
upon
my
surface
I
am
the
most
honored
of
all
Then
the
paper
was
tied
in
a
bundle
with
other
papers
and
thrown
into
a
tub
that
stood
in
the
washhouse
After
work
it
is
well
to
rest
said
the
paper
and
a
very
good
opportunity
this
is
to
collect
one
s
thoughts
Now
I
am
able
for
the
first
time
to
think
of
my
real
condition
and
to
know
one
s
self
is
true
progress
What
will
be
done
with
me
now
I
wonder
No
doubt
I
shall
still
go
forward
Now
it
happened
one
day
that
all
the
paper
in
the
tub
was
taken
out
and
laid
on
the
hearth
to
be
burnt
People
said
it
could
not
be
sold
at
the
shop
to
wrap
up
butter
and
sugar
because
it
had
been
written
upon
The
children
in
the
house
stood
round
the
stove
for
they
wanted
to
see
the
paper
burn
because
it
flamed
up
so
prettily
and
afterwards
among
the
ashes
so
many
red
sparks
could
be
seen
running
one
after
the
other
here
and
there
as
quick
as
the
wind
They
called
it
seeing
the
children
come
out
of
school
and
the
last
spark
was
the
schoolmaster
They
often
thought
the
last
spark
had
come
and
one
would
cry
There
goes
the
schoolmaster
but
the
next
moment
another
spark
would
appear
shining
so
beautifully
How
they
would
like
to
know
where
the
sparks
all
went
to
Perhaps
we
shall
find
out
some
day
but
we
don
t
know
now
The
whole
bundle
of
paper
had
been
placed
on
the
fire
and
was
soon
alight
Ugh
cried
the
paper
as
it
burst
into
a
bright
flame
ugh
It
was
certainly
not
very
pleasant
to
be
burning
but
when
the
whole
was
wrapped
in
flames
the
flames
mounted
up
into
the
air
higher
than
the
flax
had
ever
been
able
to
raise
its
little
blue
flower
and
they
glistened
as
the
white
linen
never
could
have
glistened
All
the
written
letters
became
quite
red
in
a
moment
and
all
the
words
and
thoughts
turned
into
fire
Now
I
am
mounting
straight
up
to
the
sun
said
a
voice
in
the
flames
and
it
was
as
if
a
thousand
voices
echoed
the
words
and
the
flames
darted
up
through
the
chimney
and
went
out
at
the
top
Then
a
number
of
tiny
beings
as
many
in
number
as
the
flowers
on
the
flax
had
been
and
invisible
to
mortal
eyes
floated
above
them
They
were
even
lighter
and
more
delicate
than
the
flowers
from
which
they
were
born
and
as
the
flames
were
extinguished
and
nothing
remained
of
the
paper
but
black
ashes
these
little
things
danced
upon
it
and
whenever
they
touched
it
bright
red
sparks
appeared

Stood

With

Legs
wide

As

Oppressive

Until

Then
off

flung

And
held

By

Where

Perched

The

flashed
his

Soared
up

like
fire
The

flashed

presently
Softened

A

When

You

Nay

Touched

And

Smiling
the

LIV
EGYPT
AND
ITS
RUINS
Illustration
Egypt
embraces
that
part
of
Africa
occupied
by
the
valley
of
the
River
Nile
For
many
centuries
it
was
a
thickly
populated
country
and
at
one
time
possessed
great
influence
and
wealth
and
had
reached
an
advanced
state
of
civilization
The
history
of
Egypt
extends
through
a
period
of
about
six
thousand
years
During
this
time
great
cities
were
built
which
flourished
for
hundreds
of
years
Owing
to
wars
and
changes
of
government
many
of
these
cities
were
destroyed
and
nothing
of
them
now
remains
but
massive
and
extensive
ruins
Pyramids
were
built
obelisks
erected
canals
projected
and
many
other
vast
enterprises
were
carried
out
Remains
of
these
are
to
be
seen
to
day
some
in
ruins
some
fairly
preserved
and
altogether
they
give
the
present
generation
an
idea
of
the
wealth
and
power
of
the
different
dynasties
under
which
they
were
built
Not
far
from
Cairo
which
is
now
the
principal
city
of
Egypt
stand
the
famous
pyramids
These
are
of
such
immense
proportions
that
from
a
distance
their
tops
seem
to
reach
the
clouds
They
are
constructed
of
great
blocks
of
stone
Some
of
these
are
of
great
size
and
how
the
builders
put
them
into
their
places
is
a
question
we
cannot
answer
It
is
supposed
that
the
construction
of
the
largest
pyramid
required
the
labor
of
thousands
of
men
for
more
than
twenty
years
It
is
four
hundred
and
sixty
one
feet
high
seven
hundred
and
forty
six
feet
long
at
the
base
and
covers
more
than
twelve
acres
of
ground
Sixty
seven
of
these
pyramids
in
all
have
been
discovered
and
explored
They
are
the
tombs
in
which
the
kings
of
ancient
Egypt
and
their
families
were
buried
To
contain
their
coffins
which
were
made
of
stone
many
chambers
were
constructed
in
the
interior
of
the
pyramids
It
has
been
calculated
that
one
of
the
principal
pyramids
could
contain
three
thousand
seven
hundred
rooms
of
large
size
The
bodies
of
those
who
were
buried
in
the
pyramids
were
preserved
from
decay
by
a
secret
process
which
we
call
embalming
and
which
was
known
only
to
the
priests
After
the
bodies
were
embalmed
they
were
wrapped
in
bands
of
fine
linen
and
on
the
inside
of
these
was
spread
a
peculiar
kind
of
gum
Sometimes
as
many
as
a
thousand
yards
of
these
bands
were
wrapped
around
a
single
body
After
the
bandaged
body
was
thus
prepared
a
soft
substance
was
placed
around
it
When
this
covering
hardened
it
kept
the
body
in
a
state
of
complete
preservation
These
coverings
are
now
called
mummy
cases
and
the
bodies
they
enclose
are
called
mummies
The
bodies
were
finally
placed
in
huge
stone
coffins
many
of
which
were
covered
with
curious
carvings
Some
mummies
have
been
found
that
are
said
to
be
over
three
thousand
years
old
But
notwithstanding
this
great
age
when
the
wrappings
are
removed
from
them
many
of
the
bodies
have
been
so
well
preserved
that
the
features
present
the
appearance
which
they
had
in
life
Large
numbers
of
mummies
have
been
carried
off
to
other
countries
and
placed
on
exhibition
in
museums
The
ancient
Egyptians
erected
many
obelisks
in
various
parts
of
their
country
These
were
monuments
made
from
single
pieces
of
hard
stone
and
in
some
cases
they
reached
a
height
of
more
than
a
hundred
feet
They
were
placed
before
gateways
leading
to
the
principal
temples
and
palaces
and
were
covered
with
curious
carvings
which
represented
the
language
of
the
people
at
that
time
Their
written
language
was
not
composed
of
letters
and
words
like
our
own
but
they
used
pictures
of
animals
including
birds
and
also
pictures
of
human
figures
and
other
devices
of
a
similar
nature
to
express
their
thoughts
and
ideas
These
pictures
are
now
called
hieroglyphics
Until
the
year
scholars
of
modern
nations
were
unable
to
read
this
strange
language
In
that
year
however
a
stone
tablet
was
discovered
by
a
French
engineer
containing
an
inscription
written
in
three
different
characters
namely
first
in
the
hieroglyphics
spoken
of
above
second
in
a
running
hand
also
used
by
the
Egyptians
and
third
in
the
well
known
letters
of
the
Greek
alphabet
By
comparing
the
words
of
these
inscriptions
with
many
others
the
proper
method
of
interpreting
this
peculiar
language
was
ascertained
It
was
then
learned
that
the
inscriptions
on
these
obelisks
were
the
records
of
memorable
events
and
of
the
heroic
deeds
of
ancient
kings
and
heroes
Many
of
the
obelisks
have
been
taken
from
their
positions
in
Egypt
and
transported
with
great
labor
to
other
countries
Nearly
two
thousand
years
ago
the
Roman
Emperors
began
to
carry
them
to
Rome
where
they
were
set
up
in
the
public
squares
Altogether
nearly
fifty
of
these
remarkable
monuments
were
taken
away
and
set
up
in
that
city
They
were
then
and
are
still
regarded
as
evidences
of
the
wonderful
ingenuity
and
skill
of
the
ancients
who
first
made
them
In
late
years
obelisks
have
been
taken
to
Paris
and
London
and
more
recently
one
has
been
brought
to
America
and
set
up
in
Central
Park
in
New
York
City
This
one
belongs
to
the
largest
class
being
nearly
seventy
feet
high
and
about
eight
feet
square
at
the
base
In
their
large
cities
the
Egyptians
built
massive
temples
which
were
dedicated
to
religious
ceremonies
Some
of
them
although
now
in
ruins
are
considered
to
be
among
the
most
remarkable
productions
of
the
ancients
Tourists
who
nowadays
sail
up
the
River
Nile
and
visit
the
site
of
the
city
of
Thebes
the
ancient
capital
of
Egypt
are
struck
with
amazement
at
the
vast
ruins
surrounding
them
On
the
eastern
side
of
the
Nile
lies
what
is
left
of
the
temple
of
Karnak
Imagine
a
long
line
of
courts
gateways
and
halls
with
here
and
there
an
obelisk
rising
above
the
ruins
and
shutting
off
the
view
of
the
forest
of
columns
The
temple
is
approached
on
every
side
by
avenues
and
gateways
of
colossal
grandeur
It
originally
covered
an
area
of
two
hundred
and
seventy
acres
enclosed
within
a
wall
of
brick
parts
of
which
are
still
visible
while
the
rest
lie
crumbled
and
broken
It
is
difficult
to
realize
the
grand
appearance
of
the
thirty
rows
of
stone
columns
standing
within
the
wall
Some
of
those
that
are
still
perfect
are
capped
with
enormous
monolith
capitals
and
it
is
said
that
on
one
of
them
a
hundred
men
could
stand
without
crowding
The
hall
itself
is
four
hundred
and
twenty
two
feet
long
by
one
hundred
and
sixty
five
feet
broad
The
stones
of
the
ceiling
are
supported
by
one
hundred
and
thirty
four
columns
The
largest
measures
ten
feet
in
diameter
and
more
than
seventy
two
feet
in
height
They
are
covered
with
carvings
and
paintings
whose
colors
are
still
bright
even
after
a
lapse
of
forty
centuries
Gazing
on
what
he
sees
around
him
the
traveller
becomes
lost
in
the
effort
to
form
some
idea
of
the
grandeur
and
vastness
of
the

ZLOBANE
MRS
GUSTAFSON
Zlobane
is
the
name
of
the
mountain
which
was
taken
by
storm
from
the
Zulus
by
the
British
forces
on
the
morning
of
the
th
of
March
On
the
top
of
this
mountain
the
victorious
English
troops
who
had
unsaddled
their
horses
and
cast
themselves
down
to
rest
were
surprised
and
surrounded
by
the
Zulus
Of
the
British
corps
only
one
captain
and
six
men
escaped
The
young
hero
of
the
ballad
was
the
son
of
Colonel
Weatherly
As
swayeth
in
the
summer
wind
The
close
and
stalwart
grain
So
moved
the
serried
Zulu
shields
That
day
on
wild
Zlobane
The
white
shield
of
the
husband
Who
hath
twice
need
of
life
The
black
shield
of
the
young
chief
Who
hath
not
yet
a
wife
Unrecking
harm
the
British
lay
Secure
as
if
they
slept
While
close
on
front
and
either
flank
The
live
black
crescent
crept
Then
burst
their
wild
and
frightful
cry
Upon
the
British
ears
With
whirr
of
bullets
glare
of
shields
And
flash
of
Zulu
spears
Uprose
the
British
in
the
shock
Reeled
but
an
instant
then
Shoulder
to
shoulder
faced
the
foe
And
met
their
doom
like
men
But
one
was
there
whose
heart
was
torn
In
a
more
awful
strife
He
had
the
soldier
s
steady
nerve
And
calm
disdain
of
life
Yet
now
half
turning
from
the
fray
Knee
smiting
against
knee
He
scanned
the
hills
if
yet
were
left
An
open
way
to
flee
Not
for
himself
His
little
son
Scarce
thirteen
summers
born
With
hair
that
shone
upon
his
brows
Like
tassels
of
the
corn
And
lips
yet
curled
in
that
sweet
pout
Shaped
by
the
mother
s
breast
Stood
by
his
side
and
silently
To
his
brave
father
pressed
The
horse
stood
nigh
the
father
kissed
And
tossed
the
boy
astride
Farewell
he
cried
and
for
thy
life
That
way
my
darling
ride
Scarce
touched
the
saddle
ere
the
boy
Leaped
lightly
to
the
ground
And
smote
the
horse
upon
its
flank
That
with
a
quivering
bound
It
sprang
and
galloped
for
the
hills
With
one
sonorous
neigh
The
fire
flashed
where
its
spurning
feet
Clanged
o
er
the
stony
way
Father
I
ll
die
with
you
The
sire
As
this
he
saw
and
heard
Turned
and
stood
breathless
in
the
joy
And
pang
that
knows
no
word
Once
each
as
do
long
knitted
friends

LVII
THE
RUBY
THROATED
HUMMING
BIRD
AUDUBON
The
most
common
as
well
as
the
most
beautiful
species
of
humming
birds
is
the
ruby
throat
a
name
given
to
it
on
account
of
the
delicate
metallic
feathers
which
glow
with
ruby
lustre
on
its
throat
gleaming
in
the
sunshine
like
gems
of
living
fire
From
the
tip
of
the
bill
to
that
of
the
tail
it
measures
about
three
and
a
half
inches
The
upper
part
of
the
neck
the
back
and
the
wing
coverts
are
of
a
resplendent
and
varied
green
and
gold
The
breast
and
lower
parts
are
white
the
wings
purplish
brown
and
the
tail
partly
of
the
same
color
with
the
two
middle
tail
feathers
of
vivid
green
In
the
warm
climate
of
the
Southern
States
the
beautiful
little
ruby
throat
is
found
throughout
the
winter
and
as
the
summer
draws
on
the
heat
in
the
Northern
States
and
Canada
suiting
its
delicate
constitution
it
migrates
in
large
numbers
appearing
in
Canada
towards
the
end
of
June
The
long
flights
of
these
tiny
creatures
are
performed
at
night
it
is
supposed
as
they
are
found
feeding
leisurely
at
all
times
of
the
day
When
passing
through
the
air
they
move
at
a
rapid
rate
in
long
undulations
now
rising
for
some
distance
at
an
angle
of
about
forty
degrees
then
falling
in
a
curve
Small
as
they
are
from
their
rapid
flight
and
meteor
like
movements
they
do
not
fear
the
largest
birds
of
prey
for
even
should
the
lordly
eagle
venture
into
their
domains
the
tiny
creature
will
attack
him
without
fear
and
one
has
been
seen
perched
on
the
head
of
an
eagle
at
which
it
was
pecking
away
furiously
scattering
the
feathers
of
the
huge
bird
who
flew
screaming
through
the
air
with
alarm
to
rid
himself
of
his
tiny
assailant
Brave
and
high
spirited
as
is
the
little
bird
it
is
easily
tamed
and
Mr
Webber
the
naturalist
succeeded
in
securing
several
specimens
The
first
he
caught
did
not
flutter
or
make
the
least
attempt
to
escape
but
remained
quietly
in
his
hand
and
he
saw
when
he
opened
it
the
minute
creature
lying
on
his
palm
perfectly
motionless
feigning
most
skilfully
to
be
dead
As
he
watched
it
with
breathless
curiosity
he
saw
it
slowly
open
its
bright
little
eyes
to
see
whether
the
way
was
clear
and
then
close
them
slowly
as
it
caught
his
glance
upon
it
When
a
mixture
of
sugar
water
and
honey
was
brought
and
a
drop
placed
on
its
bill
it
came
very
suddenly
to
life
and
in
a
moment
was
on
its
legs
drinking
with
eager
gusto
of
the
refreshing
draught
from
a
silver
teaspoon
The
nest
of
the
ruby
throat
is
of
a
most
delicate
nature
the
external
parts
being
formed
of
bits
of
a
little
grey
lichen
found
on
the
branches
of
trees
glued
together
by
the
saliva
of
the
bird
Bits
of
lichen
are
also
neatly
arranged
round
the
whole
of
the
nest
and
to
some
distance
from
the
spot
where
the
nest
is
attached
to
the
tree
The
interior
is
formed
of
a
cottony
substance
and
is
lined
with
silky
fibres
obtained
from
various
plants
The
difficulty
of
finding
the
little
nests
of
the
humming
birds
is
increased
by
a
curious
habit
possessed
by
some
of
the
species
When
they
leave
or
approach
their
home
they
do
so
as
if
conscious
that
by
the
bright
gleam
of
their
plumage
they
may
give
an
indication
of
the
place
of
their
nest
Rising
perpendicularly
until
they
are
out
of
sight
and
then
flying
to
the
point
under
which
their
nest
is
placed
they
drop
down
upon
it
as
perpendicularly
as
they
ascended
The
eggs
are
only
two
in
number
and
although
somewhat
larger
than
might
be
imagined
from
the
size
of
the
bird
are
very
small
indeed
They
are
of
a
delicate
slightly
pink
semi
transparent
white
color
and
have
been
well
compared
to
pearls
Could
you
cast
a
momentary
glance
on
the
nest
of
a
humming
bird
and
see
as
I
have
seen
the
newly
hatched
pair
of
young
not
much
larger
than
humble
bees
naked
blind
and
so
feeble
as
scarcely
to
be
able
to
raise
their
little
bills
to
receive
food
from
their
parents
and
could
you
see
those
parents
full
of
anxiety
and
fear
passing
and
repassing
within
a
few
inches
of
your
face
alighting
on
a
twig
not
more
than
a
yard
from
you
and
waiting
the
result
of
your
unwelcome
visit
in
a
state
of
despair
you
could
not
fail
to
be
interested
in
such
a
display
of
parental
affection
Then
how
pleasing
it
is
on
leaving
the
spot
to
see
the
returning
joy
of
the
parents
when
after
examining
the
nest
they
find
their
nurslings
untouched

LXI
ANTS
AND
THEIR
SLAVES
MICHELET
Peter
Huber
the
son
of
the
celebrated
observer
of
the
manners
and
habits
of
bees
walking
one
day
in
a
field
near
Geneva
saw
on
the
ground
a
strong
detachment
of
reddish
colored
ants
on
the
march
and
bethought
himself
of
following
them
On
the
flanks
of
the
column
as
if
to
dress
its
ranks
a
few
sped
to
and
fro
in
eager
haste
After
marching
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
halted
before
an
ant
hill
belonging
to
some
small
black
ants
and
a
desperate
struggle
took
place
at
its
gates
A
small
number
of
blacks
offered
a
brave
resistance
but
the
great
majority
of
the
people
thus
assailed
fled
through
the
gates
remotest
from
the
scene
of
combat
carrying
away
their
young
It
was
just
these
which
were
the
cause
of
the
strife
what
the
blacks
most
feared
being
the
theft
of
their
offspring
And
soon
the
assailants
who
had
succeeded
in
penetrating
into
the
city
might
be
seen
emerging
from
it
loaded
with
the
young
black
progeny
The
red
ants
encumbered
with
their
living
booty
left
the
unfortunate
city
in
the
desolation
of
its
great
loss
and
resumed
the
road
to
their
own
habitation
whither
their
astonished
and
almost
breathless
observer
followed
them
But
how
was
his
astonishment
augmented
when
at
the
threshold
of
the
red
ants
community
a
small
population
of
black
ants
came
forward
to
receive
the
plunder
welcoming
with
visible
joy
these
children
of
their
own
race
which
would
perpetuate
it
in
the
foreign
lands
This
then
is
a
mixed
city
where
the
strong
warrior
ants
live
on
a
perfectly
good
understanding
with
the
little
blacks
But
what
of
the
latter
Huber
speedily
discovered
that
in
fact
they
do
everything
They
alone
build
they
alone
bring
up
the
young
red
ants
and
the
captives
of
their
own
species
they
alone
administer
the
affairs
of
the
community
provide
its
supplies
of
food
and
wait
upon
and
feed
their
red
masters
who
like
great
infant
giants
indolently
allow
their
little
attendants
to
feed
them
at
the
mouth
No
other
occupations
are
theirs
but
war
theft
and
kidnapping
No
other
movements
in
the
intervals
than
to
wander
about
lazily
and
bask
in
the
sunshine
at
the
doors
of
their
barracks
Huber
made
an
experiment
He
was
desirous
of
observing
what
would
be
the
result
if
the
great
red
ants
found
themselves
without
servants
whether
they
would
know
how
to
supply
their
own
wants
He
put
a
few
into
a
glass
case
and
put
some
honey
for
them
in
a
corner
so
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
take
it
Miserable
the
degradation
cruel
the
punishment
with
which
slavery
afflicts
the
enslavers
They
did
not
touch
it
they
seemed
to
know
nothing
they
had
become
so
grossly
ignorant
that
they
could
no
longer
feed
themselves
Some
of
them
died
from
starvation
with
food
before
them
Huber
to
complete
the
experiment
then
introduced
into
the
case
one
black
ant
The
presence
of
this
sagacious
slave
changed
the
face
of
things
and
re
established
life
and
order
He
went
straight
to
the
honey
and
fed
the
great
dying
simpletons
The
little
blacks
in
many
things
carry
a
moral
authority
whose
signs
are
very
visible
They
do
not
for
example
permit
the
great
red
ants
to
go
out
alone
on
useless
expeditions
but
compel
them
to
return
into
the
city
Nor
are
they
even
at
liberty
to
go
out
in
a
body
if
their
wise
little
slaves
do
not
think
the
weather
favorable
if
they
fear
a
storm
or
if
the
day
is
far
advanced
When
an
excursion
proves
unsuccessful
and
they
return
without
children
the
little
blacks
are
stationed
at
the
gates
of
the
city
to
forbid
their
ingress
and
send
them
back
to
the
combat
nay
more
you
may
see
them
take
the
cowards
by
the
collar
and
force
them
to
retrace
their
route
These
are
astounding
facts
but
they
were
seen
as
here
described
by
our
illustrious
observer
Not
being
able
to
trust
his
eyes
he
summoned
one
of
the
greatest
naturalists
of
Sweden
Jurine
to
his
side
to
make
new
investigations
and
decide
whether
he
had
been
deceived
This
witness
and
others
who
afterwards
pursued
the
same
course
of
experiments
found
that
his
discoveries
were
entirely
accurate
Yet
after
all
these
weighty
testimonies
I
still
doubted
But
on
a
certain
occasion
I
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
saw
it
in
the
park
of
Fontainebleau
I
was
accompanied
by
an
illustrious
philosopher
an
excellent
observer
and
he
too
saw
exactly
what
I
saw
It
was
half
past
four
in
the
afternoon
of
a
very
warm
day
From
a
pile
of
stones
emerged
a
column
of
from
four
to
five
hundred
red
or
reddish
ants
They
marched
rapidly
towards
a
piece
of
turf
kept
in
order
by
their
sergeants
or
pivot
men
whom
we
saw
on
the
flanks
and
who
would
not
permit
any
one
to
straggle
This
is
a
circumstance
known
to
everyone
who
has
seen
a
file
of
ants
on
the
march
Suddenly
the
mass
seemed
to
sink
and
disappear
There
was
no
sign
of
ant
hills
in
the
turf
but
after
a
while
we
detected
an
almost
imperceptible
orifice
through
which
we
saw
them
vanish
in
less
time
than
it
takes
me
to
write
these
words
We
asked
ourselves
if
it
was
an
entrance
to
their
domicile
if
they
had
re
entered
their
city
In
a
minute
at
the
utmost
they
gave
us
a
reply
and
showed
us
our
mistake
They
issued
in
a
throng
each
carrying
a
captive
in
its
mandibles
From
the
short
time
they
had
taken
it
was
evident
that
they
had
a
previous
knowledge
of
the
locality
the
place
where
the
eggs
were
deposited
the
time
when
they
were
to
assemble
and
the
degree
of
resistance
they
had
to
expect
Perhaps
it
was
not
their
first
journey
The
little
blacks
on
whom
the
red
ants
made
this
raid
sallied
out
in
considerable
numbers
and
I
truly
pitied
them
They
did
not
attempt
to
fight
They
seemed
frightened
and
stunned
They
endeavored
only
to
delay
the
red
ants
by
clinging
to
them
A
red
ant
was
thus
stopped
but
another
red
one
who
was
free
relieved
him
of
his
burden
and
thereupon
the
black
ant
relaxed
his
grasp
It
was
in
fact
a
pitiful
sight
The
blacks
offered
no
serious
resistance
The
five
hundred
ants
succeeded
in
carrying
off
nearly
three
hundred
children
At
two
or
three
feet
from
the
hole
the
blacks
ceased
to
pursue
them
and
resigned
themselves
to
their
fate
All
this
did
not
occupy
ten
minutes
between
the
departure
and
the
return
The
two
parties
were
very
unequal
It
was
very
probably
an
outrage
often
repeated
a
tyranny
of
the
great
who
levied
a
tribute
of
children
from
their
poor
little
neighbors

little
lad
my
Elihu
A
sailing
with
your
ship
The
sailor
s
eyes
were
dim
with
dew
Your
little
lad
your
Elihu
He
said
with
trembling
lip
What
little
lad
What
ship
What
little
lad
as
if
there
could
be
Another
such
a
one
as
he
What
little
lad
do
you
say
Why
Elihu
that
took
to
sea
The
moment
I
put
him
off
my
knee
It
was
just
the
other
day
The
Gray
Swan
sailed
away
The
other
day
The
sailor
s
eyes
Stood
open
with
a
great
surprise
The
other
day
The
Swan
His
heart
began
in
his
throat
to
rise
Ay
ay
sir
here
in
the
cupboard
lies
The
jacket
he
had
on
And
so
your
lad
is
gone
Gone
with
the
Swan
And
did
she
stand
With
her
anchor
clutching
hold
of
the
sand
For
a
month
and
never
stir
Why
to
be
sure
I
ve
seen
from
the
land
Like
a
lover
kissing
his
lady
s
hand
The
wild
sea
kissing
her
A
sight
to
remember
sir
But
my
good
mother
do
you
know
All
this
was
twenty
years
ago
I
stood
on
the
Gray
Swan
s
deck
And
to
that
lad
I
saw
you
throw
Taking
it
off
as
it
might
be
so
The
kerchief
from
your
neck
Ay
and
he
ll
bring
it
back
And
did
the
little
lawless
lad
That
has
made
you
sick
and
made
you
sad
Sail
with
the
Gray
Swan
s
crew
Lawless
The
man
is
going
mad
The
best
boy
mother
ever
had
Be
sure
he
sailed
with
the
crew
What
would
you
have
him
do
And
he
has
never
written
line
Nor
sent
you
word
nor
made
you
sign
To
say
he
was
alive
Hold
if
twas
wrong
the
wrong
is
mine
Besides
he
may
be
in
the
brine
And
could
he
write
from
the
grave
Tut
man
What
would
you
have
Gone
twenty
years
a
long
long
cruise
Twas
wicked
thus
your
love
to
abuse
But
if
the
lad
still
live
And
come
back
home
think
you
you
can
Forgive
him
Miserable
man
You
re
mad
as
the
sea
you
rave
What
have
I
to
forgive
The
sailor
twitched
his
shirt
of
blue
And
from
within
his
bosom
drew
The
kerchief
She
was
wild
Oh
God
my
Father
is
it
true
My
little
lad
my
Elihu
And
is
it
is
it
is
it
you
My
blessed
boy
my
child
My
dead
my
living
child
My
heart
leaps
up
when
I
behold
A
rainbow
in
the
sky
So
was
it
when
my
life
began
So
is
it
now
I
am
a
man
So
be
it
when
I
shall
grow
old
Or
let
me
die
The
child
is
father
of
the
man
And
I
could
wish
my
days
to
be
Bound
each
to

LXIII
THE
CAPTURE
OF
A
WHALE
COOPER
Tom
cried
Barnstable
starting
there
is
the
blow
of
a
whale
Ay
ay
sir
returned
the
cockswain
with
undisturbed
composure
here
is
his
spout
not
half
a
mile
to
seaward
The
easterly
gale
has
driven
the
creature
to
leeward
and
he
begins
to
find
himself
in
shoal
water
He
s
been
sleeping
while
he
should
have
been
working
to
windward
The
fellow
takes
it
coolly
too
He
s
in
no
hurry
to
get
an
offing
I
rather
conclude
sir
said
the
cockswain
rolling
over
his
tobacco
in
his
mouth
very
composedly
while
his
little
sunken
eyes
began
to
twinkle
with
pleasure
at
the
sight
the
gentleman
has
lost
his
reckoning
and
doesn
t
know
which
way
to
head
to
take
himself
back
into
blue
water
Tis
a
fin
back
exclaimed
the
lieutenant
He
will
soon
make
headway
and
be
off
No
sir
tis
a
right
whale
answered
Tom
I
saw
his
spout
He
threw
up
a
pair
of
as
pretty
rainbows
as
one
could
wish
to
see
He
s
a
real
oil
butt
that
fellow
Barnstable
laughed
and
exclaimed
in
joyous
tones
Give
strong
way
my
hearties
There
seems
nothing
better
to
be
done
let
us
have
a
stroke
of
a
harpoon
at
that
impudent
rascal
The
men
shouted
spontaneously
and
the
old
cockswain
suffered
his
solemn
visage
to
relax
into
a
small
laugh
while
the
whale
boat
sprang
forward
like
a
courser
for
the
goal
During
the
few
minutes
they
were
pulling
toward
their
game
Long
Tom
arose
from
his
crouching
attitude
in
the
stern
sheets
and
transferred
his
huge
frame
to
the
bows
of
the
boat
where
he
made
such
preparations
to
strike
the
whale
as
the
occasion
required
The
tub
containing
about
half
a
whale
line
was
placed
at
the
feet
of
Barnstable
who
had
been
preparing
an
oar
to
steer
with
in
place
of
the
rudder
which
was
unshipped
in
order
that
if
necessary
the
boat
might
be
whirled
round
when
not
advancing
Their
approach
was
utterly
unnoticed
by
the
monster
of
the
deep
who
continued
to
amuse
himself
with
throwing
the
water
in
two
circular
spouts
high
into
the
air
occasionally
flourishing
the
broad
flukes
of
his
tail
with
graceful
but
terrific
force
until
the
hardy
seamen
were
within
a
few
hundred
feet
of
him
when
he
suddenly
cast
his
head
downward
and
without
apparent
effort
reared
his
immense
body
for
many
feet
above
the
water
waving
his
tail
violently
and
producing
a
whizzing
noise
that
sounded
like
the
rushing
of
winds
The
cockswain
stood
erect
poising
his
harpoon
ready
for
the
blow
but
when
he
beheld
the
creature
assuming
this
formidable
attitude
he
waved
his
hand
to
his
commander
who
instantly
signed
to
his
men
to
cease
rowing
In
this
situation
the
sportsman
rested
a
few
minutes
while
the
whale
struck
several
blows
on
the
water
in
rapid
succession
the
noise
of
which
re
echoed
along
the
cliffs
like
the
hollow
reports
of
so
many
cannon
After
this
wanton
exhibition
of
his
terrible
strength
the
monster
sank
again
into
his
native
element
and
slowly
disappeared
Which
way
did
he
head
Tom
cried
Barnstable
the
moment
the
whale
was
out
of
sight
Pretty
much
up
and
down
sir
returned
the
cockswain
his
eye
brightening
with
the
excitement
of
the
sport
He
ll
soon
run
his
nose
against
the
bottom
if
he
stands
long
on
that
course
and
will
be
glad
to
get
another
snuff
of
pure
air
Send
her
a
few
fathoms
to
starboard
sir
and
I
promise
we
shall
not
be
out
of
his
track
The
conjecture
of
the
experienced
old
seaman
proved
true
for
in
a
few
minutes
the
water
broke
near
them
and
another
spout
was
cast
into
the
air
when
the
huge
animal
rushed
for
half
his
length
in
the
same
direction
and
fell
on
the
sea
with
a
turbulence
and
foam
equal
to
that
which
is
produced
by
the
launching
of
a
vessel
for
the
first
time
into
its
proper
element
After
this
evolution
the
whale
rolled
heavily
and
seemed
to
rest
from
further
efforts
His
slightest
movements
were
closely
watched
by
Barnstable
and
his
cockswain
and
when
he
was
in
a
state
of
comparative
rest
the
former
gave
the
signal
to
his
crew
to
ply
their
oars
once
more
A
few
long
and
vigorous
strokes
sent
the
boat
directly
up
to
the
broadside
of
the
whale
with
its
bows
pointing
towards
one
of
the
fins
which
was
at
times
as
the
animal
yielded
sluggishly
to
the
action
of
the
waves
exposed
to
view
The
cockswain
poised
his
harpoon
with
much
precision
and
then
darted
it
from
him
with
a
violence
that
buried
the
iron
in
the
body
of
their
foe
The
instant
the
blow
was
made
Long
Tom
shouted
with
singular
earnestness
Starn
all
Stern
all
echoed
Barnstable
when
the
obedient
seamen
by
united
efforts
forced
the
boat
in
a
backward
direction
beyond
the
reach
of
any
blow
from
their
formidable
antagonist
The
alarmed
animal
however
meditated
no
such
resistance
Ignorant
of
his
own
power
and
of
the
insignificance
of
his
enemies
he
sought
refuge
in
flight
One
moment
of
stupid
surprise
succeeded
the
entrance
of
the
iron
then
casting
his
huge
tail
into
the
air
with
a
violence
that
threw
the
sea
around
him
into
increased
commotion
he
disappeared
with
the
quickness
of
lightning
amid
a
cloud
of
foam
Snub
him
shouted
Barnstable
Hold
on
Tom
he
rises
already
Ay
ay
sir
replied
the
composed
cockswain
seizing
the
line
which
was
running
out
of
the
boat
with
a
velocity
that
rendered
such
a
man
uvre
rather
hazardous
and
causing
it
to
yield
more
gradually
round
the
large
loggerhead
that
was
placed
in
the
bows
of
the
boat
for
that
purpose
Presently
the
line
stretched
forward
and
rising
to
the
surface
with
tremulous
vibrations
it
indicated
the
direction
in
which
the
animal
might
be
expected
to
reappear
Barnstable
had
cast
the
bows
of
the
boat
towards
that
point
before
the
terrified
and
wounded
victim
rose
to
the
surface
His
time
was
however
no
longer
wasted
in
his
sports
but
as
he
ploughed
his
way
along
the
surface
he
forced
the
waters
aside
with
prodigious
energy
The
boat
was
dragged
violently
in
his
wake
and
it
cut
through
the
billows
with
a
terrific
rapidity
that
at
moments
appeared
to
bury
it
in
the
ocean
When
Long
Tom
beheld
his
victim
throwing
his
spouts
on
high
again
he
pointed
with
exultation
to
the
jetting
fluid
which
was
streaked
with
the
deep
red
of
blood
and
cried
Ay
I
ve
touched
the
fellow
s
life
It
must
be
more
than
two
foot
of
blubber
that
stops
my
iron
from
reaching
the
life
of
any
whale
that
ever
sculled
the
ocean
I
believe
you
have
saved
yourself
the
trouble
of
using
the
bayonet
you
have
rigged
for
a
lance
said
his
commander
who
entered
into
the
sport
with
all
the
ardor
of
one
whose
youth
had
been
chiefly
passed
in
such
pursuits
Feel
your
line
Master
Coffin
can
we
haul
alongside
of
our
enemy
I
like
not
the
course
he
is
steering
as
he
tows
us
from
the
schooner
Tis
the
creatur
s
way
sir
said
the
cockswain
You
know
they
need
the
air
in
their
nostrils
when
they
run
the
same
as
a
man
But
lay
hold
boys
and
let
us
haul
up
to
him
The
seamen
now
seized
their
whale
line
and
slowly
drew
their
boat
to
within
a
few
feet
of
the
tail
of
the
fish
whose
progress
became
sensibly
less
rapid
as
he
grew
weak
with
the
loss
of
blood
In
a
few
minutes
he
stopped
running
and
appeared
to
roll
uneasily
on
the
water
as
if
suffering
the
agony
of
death
Shall
we
pull
in
and
finish
him
Tom
cried
Barnstable
A
few
sets
from
your
bayonet
would
do
it
The
cockswain
stood
examining
his
game
with
cool
discretion
and
replied
to
this
interrogatory
No
sir
no
He
s
going
into
his
flurry
there
s
no
occasion
for
using
a
soldier
s
weapon
in
taking
a
whale
Starn
off
sir
starn
off
the
creatur
s
in
his
flurry
The
warning
of
the
prudent
cockswain
was
promptly
obeyed
and
the
boat
cautiously
drew
off
to
a
distance
leaving
to
the
animal
a
clear
space
while
under
its
dying
agonies
From
a
state
of
perfect
rest
the
terrible
monster
threw
its
tail
on
high
as
when
in
sport
but
its
blows
were
trebled
in
rapidity
and
violence
till
all
was
hid
from
view
by
a
pyramid
of
foam
that
was
deeply
dyed
with
blood
The
roarings
of
the
fish
were
like
the
bellowings
of
a
herd
of
bulls
and
it
seemed
as
if
a
thousand
monsters
were
engaged
in
deadly
combat
behind
the
bloody
mist
that
obstructed
the
view
Gradually
these
efforts
subsided
and
when
the
discolored
water
again
settled
down
to
the
long
and
regular
swell
of
the
ocean
the
fish
was
seen
exhausted
and
yielding
passively
to
its
fate
As
life
departed
the
enormous
black
mass
rolled
to
one
side
and
when
the
white
and
glistening
skin
of
the
belly
became
apparent
the
seamen
well
knew
that
their
victory
was
achieved

LXV
THE
MONSTER
OF
THE
NILE
SIR
SAMUEL
BAKER
Few
creatures
are
so
sly
and
wary
as
the
crocodile
I
watch
them
continually
as
they
attack
the
dense
flocks
of
small
birds
that
throng
the
bushes
at
the
water
s
edge
These
birds
are
perfectly
aware
of
the
danger
and
they
fly
from
the
attack
if
possible
The
crocodile
then
quietly
and
innocently
lies
upon
the
surface
as
though
it
had
appeared
quite
by
an
accident
It
thus
attracts
the
attention
of
the
birds
and
it
slowly
sails
away
to
a
considerable
distance
exposed
to
their
view
The
birds
thus
beguiled
by
the
deceiver
believe
that
the
danger
is
removed
and
they
again
flock
to
the
bush
and
once
more
dip
their
thirsty
beaks
in
the
stream
Thus
absorbed
in
slaking
their
thirst
they
do
not
observe
that
their
enemy
is
no
longer
on
the
surface
A
sudden
splash
followed
by
a
huge
pair
of
jaws
beneath
the
bush
which
engulf
some
dozens
of
victims
is
the
signal
unexpectedly
given
of
the
crocodile
s
return
he
having
slily
dived
and
hastened
under
cover
of
water
to
his
victims
I
have
seen
the
crocodile
repeat
this
man
uvre
constantly
they
deceive
by
a
feigned
retreat
and
then
attack
from
below
In
like
manner
the
crocodile
perceives
while
it
is
floating
on
the
surface
in
mid
stream
or
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
a
woman
filling
her
girba
or
an
animal
drinking
Sinking
immediately
it
swims
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
nearer
and
again
appearing
for
an
instant
upon
the
surface
it
assures
itself
of
the
position
of
its
prey
by
a
steady
look
Once
more
it
sinks
and
reaches
the
exact
spot
above
which
the
person
or
animal
may
be
Seeing
distinctly
through
the
water
it
generally
makes
its
fatal
rush
from
beneath
sometimes
seizing
with
its
jaws
and
at
other
times
striking
the
object
into
the
water
with
its
tail
after
which
it
seizes
it
and
carries
it
off
The
crocodile
does
not
attempt
to
swallow
a
large
prey
at
once
but
generally
carries
it
away
and
keeps
it
for
a
considerable
time
in
its
jaws
in
some
deep
hole
beneath
a
rock
or
the
root
of
a
tree
where
it
eats
it
at
leisure
The
tongue
of
the
crocodile
is
so
unlike
that
of
any
other
creature
that
it
can
hardly
be
called
by
the
same
name
No
portion
of
it
is
detached
from
the
flesh
of
the
lower
jaw
it
is
like
a
thickened
membrane
extending
from
the
gullet
to
about
half
way
along
the
length
of
jaw
I
was
one
day
returning
from
head
quarters
to
my
station
a
distance
of
a
mile
and
a
half
along
the
river
s
bank
when
I
noticed
the
large
head
of
a
crocodile
about
thirty
yards
from
the
shore
I
knew
every
inch
of
the
river
and
I
was
satisfied
that
the
water
was
shallow
A
solitary
piece
of
waving
rush
that
grew
upon
the
bank
exactly
opposite
the
crocodile
marked
its
position
So
stooping
down
I
retreated
inland
from
the
bank
and
then
running
forward
I
crept
gently
towards
the
rush
Stooping
as
low
as
possible
I
advanced
till
very
near
the
bank
upon
which
grew
tufts
of
grass
when
by
slowly
raising
my
head
I
could
observe
the
head
of
the
crocodile
in
the
same
position
not
more
than
twenty
six
or
twenty
eight
yards
from
me
At
that
distance
my
rifle
could
hit
a
half
crown
I
therefore
made
sure
of
bagging
The
bank
was
about
four
feet
above
the
water
thus
the
angle
was
favorable
and
I
aimed
just
behind
the
eye
Almost
as
I
touched
the
trigger
the
crocodile
gave
a
convulsive
start
and
turning
slowly
on
its
back
it
stretched
its
four
legs
above
the
surface
straining
every
muscle
It
then
remained
motionless
in
water
about
two
feet
deep
My
horse
was
always
furnished
with
a
long
halter
or
tethering
rope
So
I
ordered
two
men
to
jump
into
the
river
and
secure
the
crocodile
by
a
rope
fastened
round
the
body
behind
the
fore
legs
This
was
quickly
accomplished
and
the
men
remained
knee
deep
hauling
upon
the
rope
to
prevent
the
stream
from
carrying
away
the
body
In
the
meantime
an
attendant
had
mounted
my
horse
and
galloped
off
to
the
camp
for
assistance
Crocodiles
are
very
tenacious
of
life
and
although
they
may
be
shot
through
the
brain
and
be
actually
dead
for
all
practical
purposes
they
will
remain
motionless
at
first
but
they
will
begin
instinctively
to
move
the
limbs
and
tail
a
few
minutes
after
receiving
the
shot
If
lying
upon
a
sand
bank
or
in
deep
water
they
would
generally
disappear
unless
secured
by
a
rope
as
the
spasmodic
movements
of
the
limbs
and
tail
would
act
upon
the
water
and
the
body
would
be
carried
away
The
crocodile
which
had
appeared
stone
dead
now
began
to
move
its
tail
and
my
two
men
who
were
holding
on
to
the
rope
cried
out
that
it
was
still
alive
It
was
in
vain
that
I
assured
the
frightened
fellows
that
it
was
dead
I
was
on
the
bank
and
they
were
in
the
water
within
a
few
feet
of
the
crocodile
which
made
some
difference
in
our
ideas
of
its
vivacity
Presently
the
creature
really
began
to
struggle
and
the
united
efforts
of
the
men
could
hardly
restrain
it
from
getting
into
deeper
water
The
monster
now
began
to
yawn
which
so
terrified
the
men
that
they
would
have
dropped
the
rope
and
fled
had
they
not
been
afraid
of
the
consequences
as
I
was
addressing
them
rather
forcibly
from
the
bank
I
put
another
shot
through
the
shoulder
of
the
struggling
monster
which
appeared
to
act
as
a
narcotic
until
the
arrival
of
the
soldiers
with
ropes
No
sooner
was
the
crocodile
well
secured
than
it
began
to
struggle
violently
But
a
great
number
of
men
hauled
upon
the
rope
and
when
it
was
safely
landed
I
gave
it
a
blow
with
a
sharp
ax
on
the
back
of
the
neck
which
killed
it
by
dividing
the
spine
It
was
now
dragged
along
the
turf
until
we
reached
the
camp
where
it
was
carefully
measured
with
a
tape
and
showed
an
exact
length
of
twelve
feet
three
inches
from
snout
to
end
of
tail
The
stomach
contained
about
five
pounds
weight
of
pebbles
as
though
it
had
fed
upon
flesh
resting
upon
a
gravel
bank
and
had
swallowed
the
pebbles
that
had
adhered
Mixed
with
the
pebbles
was
a
greenish
slimy
matter
that
appeared
woolly
In
the
midst
of
this
were
three
undeniable
witnesses
that
convicted
the
crocodile
of
wilful
murder
A
necklace
and
two
armlets
such
as
are
worn
by
the
negro
girls
were
taken
from
the
stomach
This
was
an
old
malefactor
that
was
a
good
riddance
I
have
frequently
seen
crocodiles
upwards
of
eighteen
feet
in
length
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
they
sometimes
exceed
twenty
but
a
very
small
creature
of
this
species
may
carry
away
a
man
while
swimming

PRAYER
JAMES
MONTGOMERY
Prayer
is
the
soul
s
sincere
desire
Uttered
or
unexpressed
The
motion
of
a
hidden
fire
That
trembles
in
the
breast
Prayer
is
the
burthen
of
a
sigh
The
falling
of
a
tear
The
upward
glancing
of
the
eye
When
none
but
God
is
near
Prayer
is
the
simplest
form
of
speech
That
infant
lips
can
try
Prayer
the
sublimest
strains
that
reach
The
Majesty
on
high
Prayer
is
the
contrite
sinner
s
voice
Returning
from
his
ways
While
angels
in
their
songs
rejoice
And
cry
Behold
he
prays
Prayer
is
the
Christian
s
vital
breath
The
Christian
s
native
air
His
watchword
at
the
gates
of
death
He
enters
Heaven
with
prayer
The
saints
in
prayer
appear
as
one
In
word
and
deed
and
mind
While
with
the
Father
and
the
Son
Sweet
fellowship
they
find
Nor
prayer
is
made
by
man
alone
The
Holy
Spirit
pleads
And
Jesus
on
the
eternal
Throne
For
mourners
intercedes
O
Thou
by
whom
we
come
to
God
The
Life
the
Truth
the
Way
The
path
of
prayer
Thyself
hast
trod
Lord
teach
us
how
to
pray
Like
as
a
father
pitieth
his
children
so
the
Lord
pitieth
them
that

Him

LXVII
THE
THERMOMETER
All
substances
produce
in
us
when
we
touch
them
the
sensation
of
heat
or
of
cold
The
degree
of
heat
of
any
substance
is
called
its
temperature
and
the
temperature
varies
from
time
to
time
according
to
circumstances
Boiling
water
for
example
contains
so
much
heat
that
it
scalds
the
skin
but
when
removed
from
the
fire
the
water
gradually
becomes
less
and
less
warm
until
at
last
it
contains
so
little
heat
that
it
cools
the
hand
instead
of
scalding
it
Our
feelings
do
not
always
give
us
true
information
about
the
temperature
of
the
bodies
by
which
we
are
surrounded
A
person
comes
into
a
warm
room
from
the
open
air
on
a
cold
day
and
exclaims
How
warm
it
is
here
Another
person
enters
the
same
room
from
one
still
warmer
and
cries
How
cold
it
is
here
The
first
person
gains
heat
and
therefore
calls
the
room
warm
the
second
loses
heat
and
calls
it
cold
while
in
reality
the
air
of
the
room
all
the
while
is
at
the
same
degree
of
temperature
A
nurse
prepares
water
for
a
child
s
bath
and
measures
the
heat
by
the
feeling
of
her
hand
but
she
learns
from
the
quick
and
sudden
cry
of
the
child
when
placed
in
the
bath
that
what
seemed
warm
to
her
is
cold
to
the
child
These
examples
show
that
our
sensations
are
not
always
a
true
test
of
temperature
and
thus
if
we
wish
to
measure
heat
and
cold
accurately
we
must
have
some
instrument
made
for
the
purpose
Such
an
instrument
we
have
it
is
called
a
thermometer
a
word
which
means
heat
measurer
It
was
long
ago
noticed
that
bodies
expand
or
swell
out
when
they
are
heated
and
that
they
contract
or
shrink
into
less
bulk
when
they
are
cooled
This
observation
led
to
the
construction
of
the
thermometer
for
to
measure
the
expansion
or
contraction
of
a
substance
is
the
same
as
to
measure
the
quantity
of
heat
that
has
produced
this
effect
The
thermometer
consists
of
a
small
glass
tube
of
very
fine
bore
and
ending
in
a
hollow
bulb
The
bulb
is
entirely
filled
with
a
fluid
metal
called
mercury
or
quicksilver
which
rises
or
falls
in
the
tube
according
as
it
is
heated
or
cooled
The
space
in
the
tube
above
the
mercury
is
empty
it
does
not
even
contain
air
for
in
preparing
the
instrument
sufficient
heat
is
applied
to
the
bulb
to
make
the
fluid
by
expansion
fill
the
whole
tube
which
is
then
closely
sealed
at
the
upper
end
by
melting
the
glass
the
mercury
sinks
as
it
cools
and
leaves
the
space
empty
The
tube
is
fastened
to
a
metal
or
wooden
plate
marked
so
as
to
measure
the
expansion
of
the
mercury
This
is
called
the
scale
and
the
divisions
upon
it
are
called
degrees
The
degrees
are
counted
upwards
from
the
bottom
and
are
expressed
by
placing
a
small
circle
over
the
number
There
are
three
different
scales
in
use
that
commonly
used
in
this
country
is
called
Fahrenheit
s
scale
from
the
name
of
the
inventor
When
the
tube
of
the
thermometer
is
immersed
in
melting
ice
or
freezing
water
the
upper
surface
of
the
mercury
stands
always
at
the
same
point
which
is
called
the
freezing
point
of
water
On
Fahrenheit
s
thermometer
this
point
is
marked
Again
when
the
bulb
is
held
in
the
steam
of
boiling
water
the
mercury
rises
to
a
fixed
point
which
is
called
the
boiling
point
of
water
and
is
marked
All
bodies
that
are
as
hot
as
boiling
water
raise
the
mercury
to
and
all
bodies
that
are
as
cold
as
freezing
water
make
the
mercury
shrink
to
The
space
between
these
two
points
is
divided
into
equal
parts
each
being
called
a
degree
Similar
equal
divisions
are
carried
below
the
point
marked
till
is
reached
and
this
last
point
is
called
zero
The
tube
of
the
thermometer
may
contain
some
other
fluid
than
mercury
but
as
this
metal
is
in
every
respect
well
fitted
for
the
purpose
it
is
most
generally
used
in
construction
of
the
instrument
The
thermometer
is
one
of
the
most
useful
inventions
of
science
It
enables
travellers
to
compare
the
climates
of
different
countries
and
to
give
us
who
stay
at
home
a
distinct
idea
of
them
It
is
also
necessary
in
the
arts
it
enables
workmen
to
apply
the
exact
amount
of
heat
required
in
delicate
operations
where
a
little
excess
might
spoil
the
whole
work

LXVIII
GOLDEN
DEEDS
What
is
a
golden
deed
It
is
something
which
we
do
for
the
good
of
others
when
we
think
more
of
them
than
we
do
of
ourselves
And
it
is
called
golden
because
the
rarest
and
most
precious
things
in
all
the
world
are
the
acts
of
unselfish
men
Let
me
tell
you
the
story
of
a
golden
deed
that
was
performed
by
Sir
Philip
Sidney
This
brave
English
knight
was
fighting
in
the
Netherlands
to
help
the
Dutch
in
their
struggle
for
liberty
against
the
tyrant
Philip
of
Spain
In
a
fierce
battle
he
was
struck
by
a
musket
ball
which
broke
his
thigh
bone
Thirsty
and
faint
from
loss
of
blood
he
called
for
water
He
had
just
raised
the
cup
to
his
lips
when
his
eye
fell
on
a
poor
dying
soldier
who
was
looking
longingly
at
the
cool
drink
Without
so
much
as
tasting
it
Sidney
handed
the
cup
to
the
poor
fellow
with
these
words
Thy
necessity
is
greater
than
mine
Here
is
the
story
of
another
golden
deed
A
little
boy
named
Peter
who
lived
in
Holland
a
long
time
ago
was
once
on
his
way
home
late
in
the
evening
when
he
became
alarmed
at
hearing
water
trickling
through
a
sluice
or
gate
in
one
of
the
many
dikes
which
are
so
necessary
for
the
safety
of
that
country
for
you
must
know
that
Holland
is
so
flat
and
low
that
it
is
in
constant
danger
of
finding
itself
under
water
He
stopped
and
thought
of
what
would
happen
if
the
hole
were
not
closed
He
had
often
heard
his
father
tell
of
the
sad
disasters
which
had
come
from
such
small
beginnings
as
this
how
in
a
few
hours
the
little
aperture
gradually
enlarged
until
the
whole
defence
was
washed
away
and
the
rolling
dashing
angry
sea
rushed
in
and
swept
on
to
the
next
village
destroying
life
and
property
Should
he
run
home
and
alarm
the
villagers
it
would
be
dark
before
they
could
arrive
and
the
hole
even
then
might
become
so
large
as
to
defy
all
attempts
to
close
What
could
he
do
to
prevent
such
a
terrible
ruin
he
only
a
little
boy
He
sat
down
on
the
bank
of
the
canal
stopped
the
opening
with
his
hand
and
patiently
awaited
the
passing
of
a
villager
But
no
one
came
Hour
after
hour
rolled
by
yet
there
sat
the
heroic
boy
in
cold
and
darkness
shivering
wet
and
tired
but
stoutly
pressing
his
hand
against
the
water
that
was
trying
to
pass
the
dangerous
breach
The
remainder
of
the
story
is
thus
told
by
an
American
poet
Miss
Ph
be
Cary
He
thinks
of
his
brother
and
sister
Asleep
in
their
safe
warm
bed
He
thinks
of
his
father
and
mother
Of
himself
as
dying
and
dead
And
of
how
when
the
night
is
over
They
must
come
and
find
him
at
last
But
he
never
thinks
he
can
leave
the
place
Where
duty
holds
him
fast
The
good
dame
in
the
cottage
Is
up
and
astir
with
the
light
For
the
thought
of
her
little
Peter
Has
been
with
her
all
the
night
And
now
she
watches
the
pathway
As
yester
eve
she
had
done
But
what
does
she
see
so
strange
and
black
Against
the
rising
sun
Her
neighbors
bearing
between
them
Something
straight
to
her
door
Her
child
is
coming
home
but
not
As
he
ever
came
before
He
is
dead
she
cries
my
darling
And
the
startled
father
hears
And
comes
and
looks
the
way
she
looks
And
fears
the
thing
she
fears
Till
a
glad
shout
from
the
bearers
Thrills
the
stricken
man
and
wife
Give
thanks
for
your
son
has
saved
our
land
And
God
has
saved
his
life
So
there
in
the
morning
sunshine
They
knelt
about
the
boy
And
every
head
was
bared
and
bent
In
tearful
reverent
joy
Tis
many
a
year
since
then
but
still
When
the
sea
roars
like
a
flood
Their
boys
are
taught
what
a
boy
can
do
Who
is
brave
and
true
and
good
For
every
man
in
that
country
Takes
his
son
by
the
hand
And
tells
him
of
little
Peter
Whose
courage
saved
the
land
They
have
many
a
valiant
hero
Remembered
through
the
years
But
never
one
whose
name
so
oft
Is
named
with
loving
tears
And
his
deed
shall
be
sung
by
the
cradle
And
told
to
the
child
on
the
knee
As
long
as
the

Holland
Divide
the
land
from
the
sea
Now
let
us
hear
of
a
golden
deed
done
more
than
two
thousand
years
ago
a
deed
that
has
made
the
names
of
Damon
and
Pythias
famous
for
ever
In
Syracuse
there
was
so
hard
a
ruler
that
the
people
made
a
plot
to
drive
him
out
of
the
city
The
plot
was
discovered
and
the
king
commanded
that
the
leaders
should
be
put
to
death
One
of
these
named
Damon
lived
at
some
distance
from
Syracuse
He
asked
that
before
he
was
put
to
death
he
might
be
allowed
to
go
home
to
say
good
bye
to
his
family
promising
that
he
would
then
come
back
to
die
at
the
appointed
time
The
king
did
not
believe
that
he
would
keep
his
word
and
said
I
will
not
let
you
go
unless
you
find
some
friend
who
will
come
and
stay
in
your
place
Then
if
you
are
not
back
on
the
day
set
for
execution
I
shall
put
your
friend
to
death
in
your
stead
The
king
thought
to
himself
Surely
no
one
will
ever
take
the
place
of
a
man
condemned
to
death
Now
Damon
had
a
very
dear
friend
named
Pythias
who
at
once
came
forward
and
offered
to
stay
in
prison
while
Damon
was
allowed
to
go
away
The
king
was
very
much
surprised
but
he
had
given
his
word
Damon
was
therefore
permitted
to
leave
for
home
while
Pythias
was
shut
up
in
prison
Many
days
passed
the
time
for
the
execution
was
close
at
hand
and
Damon
had
not
come
back
The
king
curious
to
see
how
Pythias
would
behave
now
that
death
seemed
so
near
went
to
the
prison
Your
friend
will
never
return
he
said
to
Pythias
You
are
wrong
was
the
answer
Damon
will
be
here
if
he
can
possibly
come
But
he
has
to
travel
by
sea
and
the
winds
have
been
blowing
the
wrong
way
for
several
days
However
it
is
much
better
that
I
should
die
than
he
I
have
no
wife
and
no
children
and
I
love
my
friend
so
well
that
it
would
be
easier
to
die
for
him
than
to
live
without
him
So
I
am
hoping
and
praying
that
he
may
be
delayed
until
my
head
has
fallen
The
king
went
away
more
puzzled
than
ever
The
fatal
day
arrived
Still
Damon
had
not
come
and
Pythias
was
brought
forward
and
mounted
the
scaffold
My
prayers
are
heard
he
cried
I
shall
be
permitted
to
die
for
my
friend
But
mark
my
words
Damon
is
faithful
and
true
you
will
yet
have
reason
to
know
that
he
has
done
his
utmost
to
be
here
Just
at
this
moment
a
man
came
galloping
up
at
full
speed
on
a
horse
covered
with
foam
It
was
Damon
In
an
instant
he
was
on
the
scaffold
and
had
Pythias
in
his
arms
My
beloved
friend
he
cried
the
gods
be
praised
that
you
are
safe
What
agony
have
I
suffered
in
the
fear
that
my
delay
was
putting
your
life
in
danger
There
was
no
joy
in
the
face
of
Pythias
for
he
did
not
care
to
live
if
his
friend
must
die
But
the
king
had
heard
all
At
last
he
was
forced
to
believe
in
the
unselfish
friendship
of
these
two
His
hard
heart
melted
at
the
sight
and
he
set
them
both
free
asking
only
that
they
would
be
his
friends
also

AGE
OF
TREES
Man
counts
his
life
by
years
the
oak
by
centuries
At
one
hundred
years
of
age
the
tree
is
but
a
sapling
at
five
hundred
it
is
mature
and
strong
at
six
hundred
the
gigantic
king
of
the
greenwood
begins
to
feel
the
touch
of
Time
but
the
decline
is
as
slow
as
the
growth
was
and
the
sturdy
old
tree
rears
its
proud
head
and
reckons
centuries
of
old
age
just
as
it
reckoned
centuries
of
youth
It
has
been
said
that
the
patriarch
of
the
forest
laughs
at
history
Is
it
not
true
Perhaps
when
the
balmy
zephyrs
stir
the
trees
the
leaves
whisper
strange
stories
to
one
another
The
oaks
and
the
pines
and
their
brethren
of
the
wood
have
seen
so
many
suns
rise
and
set
so
many
seasons
come
and
go
and
so
many
generations
pass
into
silence
that
we
may
well
wonder
what
the
story
of
the
trees
would
be
to
us
if
they
had
tongues
to
tell
it
or
we
ears
fine
enough
to
understand
The
king
of
white
oak
trees
says
a
letter
writer
in
the
year
has
been
chopped
down
and
taken
to
the
saw
mill
It
was
five
hundred
and
twenty
five
years
old
and
made
six
twelve
foot
logs
the
first
one
being
six
feet
in
diameter
and
weighing
seven
tons
What
a
giant
that
oak
tree
must
have
been
and
what
changes
in
this
land
of
ours
it
must
have
witnessed
It
looked
upon
the
forest
when
the
red
man
ruled
there
alone
it
was
more
than
a
century
old
when
Columbus
landed
in
the
New
World
and
to
that
good
age
it
added
nearly
four
centuries
before
the
ax
of
the
woodman
laid
it
low
Yet
venerable
as
this
king
of
white
oak
trees
was
it
was
but
an
infant
compared
with
other
monarchs
of
the
Western
solitudes
One
California
pine
cut
down
about
was
according
to
very
good
authority
eleven
hundred
and
twenty
years
old
and
many
of
its
neighbors
in
its
native
grove
are
no
less
ancient
than
it
was
Who
shall
presume
then
to
fix
the
age
of
the
hoary
trees
that
still
rear
their
stalwart
frames
in
the
unexplored
depths
of
American
wildernesses
Illustration
In
England
there
are
still
in
existence
many
trees
that
serve
to
link
the
far
off
past
with
the
living
present
Some
of
them
were
witnesses
of
the
fierce
struggles
between
Norman
and
Saxon
when
William
the
Conqueror
planted
his
standard
the
three
bannered
lions
of
Normandy
old
upon
English
soil
Then
there
is
the
King
s
Oak
at
Windsor
which
tradition
informs
us
was
a
great
favorite
with
William
when
that
bold
Norman
first
enclosed
the
forest
for
a
royal
hunting
ground
The
Conqueror
loved
to
sit
in
the
shade
of
the
lofty
spreading
tree
and
muse
upon
what
Who
knows
what
fancies
filled
his
brain
what
feelings
stirred
his
proud
spirit
what
memories
what
regrets
thrilled
his
heart
as
he
sat
there
in
the
solitude
Over
eight
hundred
years
have
rolled
away
since
the
Norman
usurper
fought
the
sturdy
Saxon
and
for
conqueror
as
for
conquered
life
and
its
ambitions
and
its
pangs
ended
long
ago
but
the
mighty
oak
whose
greenness
and
beauty
were
a
delight
to
the
Conqueror
still
stands
in
Windsor
Forest
Eight
centuries
ago
its
royal
master
saw
it
a
goodly
tree
How
old
is
it
now
Older
even
than
this
are
the
oaks
near
Croydon
nine
miles
south
of
London
If
the
botanist
may
judge
by
the
usual
evidences
of
age
these
trees
saw
the
glitter
of
the
Roman
spears
as
the
legions
of
the
Empire
wound
their
way
through
the
forest
paths
or
in
the
green
open
spaces
in
the
woodland
Now
the
Roman
legions
left
Britain
fourteen
centuries
ago
having
been
summoned
home
to
Rome
because
the
Empire
was
in
danger
in
fact
was
hastening
to
its
fall
How
wonderful
if
fourteen
centuries
have
spared
these
oaks
at
Croydon
There
is
a
famous
yew
that
must
not
go
without
notice
in
our
record
of
ancient
trees
This
venerable
tree
stands
in
its
native
field
ever
green
and
enduring
as
if
the
years
had
forgotten
it
Yet
it
was
two
centuries
old
when
in
the
adjacent
meadow
King
John
signed
Magna
Charta
If
we
bear
in
mind
that
in
the
stout
English
barons
compelled
their
wicked
king
to
sign
the
Great
Charter
protecting
the
rights
of
his
subjects
we
may
conclude
that
this
patriarch
yew
is
at
least
eight
hundred
and
fifty
years
old
The
Parliament
Oak
so
called
because
it
is
said
that
Edward
I
who
ruled
England
from
to
once
held
a
Parliament
under
its
branches
is
believed
to
be
fifteen
hundred
years
old
If
Fine
Ear
of
the
fairy
tale
could
come
and
translate
for
us
the
whispers
of
these
ancient
English
trees
and
tell
us
ever
so
little
of
what
the
stately
monarchs
of
the
wood
have
seen
what
new
histories
might
be
written
what
old
chronicles
reversed
On
the
mountains
of
Lebanon
a
few
of
the
cedars
famous
in
sacred
and
in
profane
history
yet
remain
One
of
these
relics
of
the
past
has
been
estimated
to
be
three
thousand
five
hundred
years
old
The
patriarchs
of
the
English
forests
cannot
then
so
far
as
age
is
considered
claim
equal
rank
with
the
cedars
of
Lebanon
But
the
baobab
or
monkey
bread
of
Senegal
must
take
the
first
rank
among
long
lived
trees
Even
the
goodly
trees
of
Lebanon
must
if
ordinary
proofs
can
be
trusted
yield
the
palm
to
their
African
rival
An
eminent
French
botanist
of
the
eighteenth
century
whose
discoveries
in
natural
history
are
of
great
interest
to
the
world
of
science
lived
some
years
in
Senegal
and
had
ample
opportunity
to
observe
and
study
the
wonderful
baobab
He
saw
several
trees
of
this
species
growing
and
from
the
most
careful
calculations
he
formed
his
opinion
as
to
the
age
of
some
of
these
African
wonders
One
baobab
which
even
in
its
decay
measured
one
hundred
and
nine
feet
in
circumference
he
believed
to
be
more
than
five
thousand
years
old
Truly
the
patriarchs
of
the
forest
laugh
at
history

LXXII
HEAT
CONDUCTION
AND
RADIATION
In
a
former
lesson
you
read
a
description
of
the
thermometer
a
useful
instrument
which
enables
us
to
estimate
the
temperature
or
sensible
heat
of
substances
All
bodies
even
the
coldest
contain
heat
and
they
have
also
a
tendency
to
part
with
their
heat
to
colder
substances
around
them
until
all
have
the
same
temperature
Thus
when
you
lay
your
hand
on
a
block
of
iron
or
marble
heat
leaves
your
hand
to
enter
the
less
warm
material
and
raise
its
temperature
and
it
is
this
abstraction
of
heat
that
produces
in
you
the
sensation
of
cold
There
is
then
a
constant
communication
or
transmission
of
heat
from
one
body
to
another
This
communication
is
effected
chiefly
in
two
ways
by
conduction
and
by
radiation
In
conduction
the
bodies
are
in
contact
in
radiation
they
are
at
some
distance
apart
If
you
push
one
end
of
a
cold
poker
into
the
fire
that
end
will
soon
become
warm
and
the
heat
will
be
propagated
from
particle
to
particle
through
the
poker
until
the
end
most
distant
from
the
fire
becomes
too
hot
to
be
touched
without
injury
This
mode
of
transmission
is
called
conduction
Different
substances
possess
this
power
in
very
different
degrees
Thus
if
instead
of
a
poker
you
thrust
into
the
fire
a
bar
of
wood
of
equal
length
and
thickness
you
will
find
that
even
when
the
inserted
end
is
in
flames
the
other
remains
comparatively
cold
and
may
be
handled
with
impunity
Hence
we
say
that
iron
is
a
good
conductor
and
wood
a
bad
conductor
of
heat
The
conducting
power
of
bodies
depends
in
a
great
measure
on
the
closeness
of
their
particles
dense
solid
substances
being
much
better
conductors
than
those
which
are
light
and
porous
The
metals
are
the
best
conductors
but
they
differ
very
much
among
themselves
The
best
is
silver
the
others
stand
in
this
respect
in
the
following
order
copper
gold
brass
tin
iron
steel
lead
You
will
now
understand
why
metals
feel
cold
to
the
touch
it
is
because
being
good
conductors
they
carry
the
heat
rapidly
away
from
that
part
of
our
body
with
which
they
are
in
contact
Among
the
bad
conductors
of
heat
are
fur
wool
cotton
silk
and
linen
straw
paper
feathers
wood
earth
snow
water
and
air
and
loose
bodies
such
as
sawdust
and
shavings
which
contain
a
large
amount
of
air
in
the
spaces
between
their
particles
Our
clothing
as
you
know
is
made
of
wool
cotton
or
linen
Can
you
tell
why
such
materials
are
selected
for
the
purpose
It
is
not
as
many
ignorant
people
suppose
because
they
are
best
adapted
to
impart
warmth
The
true
reason
is
that
being
bad
conductors
they
prevent
the
cold
air
and
other
objects
around
us
from
robbing
us
of
the
heat
which
is
produced
within
our
bodies
When
once
you
understand
what
is
meant
by
conduction
of
heat
and
can
distinguish
between
substances
which
are
good
conductors
and
those
which
are
not
you
will
be
able
to
give
a
reason
for
many
facts
that
must
appear
strange
to
every
one
who
does
not
possess
such
information
A
little
reflection
for
instance
will
enable
you
to
explain
why
a
linen
garment
feels
colder
to
the
skin
than
one
made
of
cotton
or
wool
why
a
silver
spoon
becomes
hot
when
the
bowl
is
left
for
a
few
minutes
in
a
cup
of
hot
liquid
why
a
metal
tea
pot
or
kettle
is
commonly
furnished
with
a
handle
of
wood
or
ivory
why
ice
may
be
preserved
by
being
wrapped
in
flannel
or
covered
with
sawdust
why
a
pump
in
frosty
weather
should
be
encased
in
straw
or
matting
and
why
the
farmer
welcomes
the
snow
and
regards
it
as
a
protection
to
his
crops
Every
warm
body
has
the
power
of
sending
out
rays
of
heat
as
a
luminous
body
gives
out
rays
of
light
This
mode
of
communicating
heat
is
called
radiation
and
it
serves
as
we
shall
see
a
very
important
purpose
in
the
economy
of
nature
When
you
stand
before
a
fire
heat
rays
stream
forth
from
the
burning
fuel
and
create
in
you
the
sensation
of
warmth
In
this
case
the
heat
of
the
fire
is
communicated
to
you
not
by
conduction
but
by
radiation
Everything
in
nature
is
constantly
radiating
heat
from
its
surface
If
a
body
be
surrounded
by
objects
hotter
than
itself
it
becomes
heated
by
radiation
if
it
be
exposed
to
the
influence
of
objects
colder
than
itself
it
becomes
cooled
by
radiation
and
if
the
objects
around
it
are
neither
hotter
nor
colder
than
itself
its
temperature
remains
unaltered
But
though
all
bodies
radiate
heat
they
have
not
all
the
same
radiating
power
Some
substances
possess
this
power
in
a
far
greater
degree
than
others
The
metals
though
they
are
the
best
conductors
are
the
worst
radiators
This
is
particularly
the
case
when
they
are
polished
Dull
dark
substances
and
especially
those
which
have
a
rough
or
scratched
surface
are
good
radiators
light
colored
and
smooth
substances
on
the
other
hand
are
bad
radiators
and
this
explains
why
as
every
good
housewife
knows
a
polished
metal
tea
pot
keeps
tea
warmer
than
a
black
earthen
one
it
does
not
part
with
its
heat
so
readily
Bodies
which
radiate
freely
have
the
power
in
an
equal
degree
of
absorbing
heat
that
is
they
are
as
ready
to
take
it
in
as
they
are
to
throw
it
out
again
Dark
substances
therefore
must
be
good
absorbers
as
they
are
good
radiators
of
heat
A
very
simple
experiment
will
illustrate
this
fact
very
clearly
If
you
spread
upon
snow
in
a
place
exposed
to
the
sunbeams
two
pieces
of
cloth
of
the
same
texture
one
black
and
the
other
white
you
will
find
after
some
time
that
under
the
black
cloth
the
snow
has
been
melted
but
under
the
white
cloth
it
remains
as
it
was
at
first
The
black
material
has
been
heated
quickly
and
intensely
the
white
has
not
been
heated
at
all
the
former
has
absorbed
the
sun
s
rays
the
latter
has
reflected
them
The
laws
of
absorption
and
radiation
enable
us
to
explain
many
curious
facts
Thus
dark
colored
clothes
are
cold
in
the
shade
because
they
are
then
radiating
heat
from
our
bodies
but
they
are
warm
in
the
sunshine
because
they
are
then
absorbing
the
heat
that
falls
upon
them
from
the
sun
On
the
other
hand
light
colored
clothes
are
warm
in
the
shade
and
cool
in
the
sunshine
Again
a
dish
cover
or
metal
tea
pot
is
kept
as
brightly
polished
as
possible
in
order
to
prevent
the
escape
of
the
heat
by
radiation
a
black
earthenware
tea
pot
on
the
contrary
has
a
dull
and
dark
surface
so
that
it
may
be
placed
on
the
hob
and
absorb
the
heat
So
too
if
a
kettle
is
to
heat
quickly
the
bottom
and
sides
should
be
covered
with
soot
to
absorb
the
heat
while
the
upper
part
should
be
bright
to
prevent
radiation
It
is
radiation
also
that
accounts
for
the
deposition
of
dew
It
is
a
common
error
to
suppose
that
dew
falls
in
the
same
manner
as
rain
or
mist
only
in
much
finer
particles
Dew
in
fact
does
not
fall
but
is
formed
on
the
surface
of
bodies
by
the
condensation
of
the
moisture
of
the
atmosphere
The
air
around
us
contains
at
all
times
a
quantity
of
moisture
in
the
form
of
vapor
Now
this
vapor
has
been
formed
from
water
by
the
action
of
heat
and
it
may
again
be
turned
into
water
by
being
brought
in
contact
with
objects
that
are
cold
And
this
is
just
what
takes
place
in
the
formation
of
dew
When
the
sun
has
set
the
trees
and
grass
and
other
objects
on
the
earth
s
surface
immediately
begin
to
radiate
the
heat
which
they
have
absorbed
from
its
beams
during
the
day
The
best
radiators
of
course
become
cool
most
rapidly
and
quickly
condense
the
vapor
that
floats
in
the
air
around
them
and
in
the
morning
we
find
those
objects
which
radiate
freely
such
as
blades
of
grass
leaves
of
plants
and
floating
cobwebs
covered
with
this
condensed
vapor
in
the
form
of
glittering
dewdrops
Clouds
in
a
great
measure
prevent
radiation
and
hence
the
dew
will
be
most
plentiful
on
a
clear
and
cloudless
night
If
the
radiation
continues
till
the
temperature
of
the
ground
is
very
low
the
dew
freezes
as
it
is
deposited
and
forms
hoar
frost
You
may
see
a
smooth
road
or
gravel
walk
quite
dry
in
the
morning
while
the
grass
or
box
by
its
side
is
thickly
coated
with
moisture
Why
is
this
It
is
simply
because
the
road
or
walk
is
a
bad
radiator
and
cools
slowly
while
the
grass
and
box
being
good
radiators
become
rapidly
cold
and
condense
the
vapor
of
the
passing
air
into
dew
Thus
by
a
wise
arrangement
the
cultivated
fields
receive
an
abundance
of
precious
moisture
while
not
a
drop
is
wasted
on
the
bare
rock
or
the
sterile
sands
of
the
desert

LXXIV
CANADIAN
TREES
JAMES
BROWN

D
FIRST
READING
SOFT
WOODS
The
principal
evergreen
or
cone
bearing
trees
natives
of
Canada
are
Pines
Firs
and
Thujas
As
every
one
cannot
distinguish
a
Pine
from
a
Fir
this
lesson
is
illustrated
with
drawings
showing
the
peculiar
character
of
each
so
that
any
boy
or
girl
may
be
able
when
looking
at
a
cone
bearing
tree
to
decide
whether
it
is
a
Pine
or
a
Fir
Fig
represents
a
small
piece
of
the
twig
of
a
White
Pine
On
examination
it
will
be
seen
that
the
leaves
are
needle
shaped
and
spring
from
the
young
shoot
in
little
tufts
of
fives
all
issuing
from
one
point
This
arrangement
and
form
of
the
leaf
are
peculiar
to
Pines
and
should
be
kept
in
mind
when
examining
a
tree
in
order
to
know
whether
it
is
a
Pine
or
a
Fir
Every
Pine
tree
however
has
not
five
leaves
issuing
from
one
point
some
have
only
two
and
there
are
others
again
that
have
three
Illustration
FIG
Fig
represents
a
twig
of
the
Hemlock
Spruce
Fir
a
tree
well
known
to
nearly
every
young
person
in
Canada
Looking
at
this
illustration
we
at
once
observe
that
the
leaves
are
distributed
singly
on
the
young
shoot
and
stand
out
in
two
rows
In
the
case
of
a
few
species
of
Fir
however
the
leaves
are
not
thus
arranged
but
are
scattered
all
round
the
twigs
being
stiff
and
pointed
as
shown
in
Fig
which
represents
a
twig
of
the
common
Black
Spruce
Fir
In
all
cases
Firs
have
their
leaves
springing
singly
from
the
twigs
an
arrangement
by
which
any
child
can
distinguish
them
from
Pines
Illustration
FIG
Of
all
our
native
trees
Pines
are
considered
the
most
valuable
as
their
timber
can
be
used
for
almost
every
purpose
for
which
wood
is
required
especially
for
house
building
ship
building
fencing
and
railway
construction
The
two
principal
species
are
the
White
and
the
Red
Pine
Illustration
FIG
The
White
Pine
is
one
of
the
grandest
trees
of
our
Canadian
forests
It
grows
to
very
large
proportions
on
dry
gravelly
lands
where
it
is
not
crowded
by
other
trees
We
often
find
individual
pine
trees
rising
to
the
height
of
feet
with
stems
from
four
to
six
feet
in
diameter
near
the
ground
but
in
general
they
may
be
said
to
reach
feet
with
a
diameter
of
about
three
feet
In
the
earlier
settled
parts
of
the
country
the
best
and
largest
trees
of
this
species
were
cut
down
long
ago
but
thousands
of
fine
specimens
are
still
to
be
met
with
in
the
backwoods
The
Red
Pine
does
not
grow
to
so
large
a
size
as
the
White
nor
is
it
found
so
plentifully
in
our
forests
It
is
to
be
met
with
only
on
dry
gravelly
knolls
and
in
rocky
parts
of
the
country
generally
in
patches
of
small
extent
and
seldom
among
other
trees
Its
timber
is
of
the
best
description
and
is
much
sought
after
by
lumbermen
Owing
to
this
cause
it
is
now
comparatively
scarce
All
Pines
are
reared
from
seeds
which
may
be
found
ripe
in
their
cones
in
the
month
of
November
Although
our
Fir
trees
are
generally
speaking
not
so
important
as
our
Pines
still
there
are
two
or
three
of
them
well
worthy
of
being
brought
under
notice
here
particularly
the
Douglas
Fir
the
Hemlock
Spruce
Fir
the
common
Black
Spruce
Fir
and
the
Balsam
Fir
The
Douglas
Fir
is
not
found
in
the
woods
east
of
the
Rocky
Mountains
but
it
grows
in
the
immense
forests
of
British
Columbia
to
heights
varying
from
to
feet
with
trunks
from
three
to
ten
feet
in
diameter
A
peculiar
feature
of
this
Fir
is
that
the
bark
on
old
trees
is
found
from
ten
to
fourteen
inches
thick
Where
full
grown
this
grand
Fir
usually
stands
apart
from
other
trees
and
forms
a
majestic
object
in
the
landscape
being
clothed
with
horizontal
branches
from
the
base
to
the
top
The
timber
is
exceedingly
durable
and
in
its
native
province
is
much
used
for
general
purposes
It
is
also
exported
for
ship
masts
the
tall
clean
stems
making
the
best
of
material
for
this
purpose
The
Hemlock
Spruce
Fir
most
young
people
of
Canada
are
acquainted
with
as
it
is
widely
distributed
and
found
in
many
bushes
of
the
country
In
open
situations
and
on
cool
bottomed
lands
the
Hemlock
is
a
noble
tree
while
young
it
is
very
graceful
in
form
and
when
approaching
maturity
its
horizontal
limbs
give
it
the
appearance
of
the
Cedar
of
Lebanon
Its
timber
however
is
not
esteemed
so
highly
as
that
of
the
Pine
being
of
a
loose
and
open
character
But
although
this
is
the
case
it
is
largely
used
for
rough
boarding
purposes
as
in
building
barns
and
in
making
side
walks
The
bark
of
this
tree
is
valuable
for
tanning
leather
The
Black
Spruce
Fir
or
Gum
Spruce
as
it
is
often
called
is
very
common
on
most
flat
and
cool
bottomed
lands
in
Canada
and
also
on
the
banks
of
lakes
and
rivers
It
is
a
tall
and
beautifully
formed
tree
having
a
dark
brown
bark
and
very
dark
green
leaves
It
is
from
these
characteristics
that
it
derives
its
name
It
grows
to
a
height
varying
from
to
feet
but
the
stems
seldom
attain
diameters
over
two
feet
at
the
bottom
The
timber
though
light
is
very
tough
and
strong
The
Balsam
is
one
of
the
handsomest
members
of
this
family
Commercially
it
is
not
of
much
value
but
as
an
ornamental
tree
it
is
unsurpassed
its
regular
conical
form
closely
set
branches
and
deep
green
leaves
rendering
it
a
conspicuous
object
in
any
landscape
The
Balsam
seldom
exceeds
forty
or
fifty
feet
in
height
Although
the
Firs
like
the
Pines
are
reared
from
seeds
which
ripen
in
October
and
November
they
may
be
grown
from
cuttings
of
the
young
wood
as
rare
kinds
sometimes
are
when
their
seeds
cannot
be
had
The
Thuja
or
Arbor
vit
as
it
is
generally
called
is
a
very
useful
class
of
Canadian
trees
It
grows
to
a
large
size
and
is
found
chiefly
on
the
Pacific
slope
There
is
only
one
species
which
is
a
native
of
Ontario
and
to
it
alone
we
shall
here
refer
It
is
known
to
most
people
in
Ontario
under
the
name
of
the
White
Cedar
How
it
came
to
be
called
a
Cedar
we
do
not
know
but
its
true
name
is
the
Arbor
vit
This
species
is
too
familiar
to
the
people
of
the
eastern
provinces
of
Canada
to
require
any
lengthened
description
as
many
farmers
have
it
growing
in
the
swampy
parts
of
their
bushes
and
find
it
useful
for
various
purposes
especially
as
rails
for
fencing
The
leaves
of
this
tree
are
so
small
that
to
a
casual
observer
they
scarcely
appear
to
be
leaves
If
they
are
closely
looked
at
however
it
will
be
seen
that
they
are
in
opposite
pairs
and
lie
flat
and
pressed
on
the
twigs
each
pair
overlapping
the
other
like
the
shingles
on
a
house
top
When
they
are
roughly
handled
they
give
out
a
strong
aromatic
smell
The
tree
although
it
grows
to
large
dimensions
some
times
to
eighty
or
ninety
feet
in
height
with
stems
from
two
to
three
feet
in
diameter
cannot
be
considered
an
ornamental
one
as
its
branches
are
too
loose
and
open
and
its
leaves
too
small
to
give
it
a
clothed
look
Its
timber
however
is
of
the
most
valuable
description
being
very
durable
and
in
this
respect
it
is
not
surpassed
by
any
other
tree

LXXV
BINGEN
ON
THE
RHINE
HON
MRS
NORTON
A
soldier
of
the
Legion
lay
dying
in
Algiers
There
was
lack
of
woman
s
nursing
there
was
dearth
of
woman
s
tears
But
a
comrade
stood
beside
him
while
his
life
blood
ebbed
away
And
bent
with
pitying
glances
to
hear
what
he
might
say
The
dying
soldier
faltered
as
he
took
that
comrade
s
hand
And
he
said
I
never
more
shall
see
my
own
my
native
land
Take
a
message
and
a
token
to
some
distant
friends
of
mine
For
I
was
born
at
Bingen
at
Bingen
on
the
Rhine
Tell
my
brothers
and
companions
when
they
meet
and
crowd
around
To
hear
my
mournful
story
in
the
pleasant
vineyard
ground
That
we
fought
the
battle
bravely
and
when
the
day
was
done
Full
many
a
corpse
lay
ghastly
pale
beneath
the
setting
sun
And
mid
the
dead
and
dying
were
some
grown
old
in
wars
The
death
wound
on
their
gallant
breasts
the
last
of
many
scars
But
some
were
young
and
suddenly
beheld
life
s
morn
decline
And
one
had
come
from
Bingen
fair
Bingen
on
the
Rhine
Tell
my
mother
that
her
other
sons
shall
comfort
her
old
age
And
I
was
aye
a
truant
bird
that
thought
his
home
a
cage
For
my
father
was
a
soldier
and
even
as
a
child
My
heart
leaped
forth
to
hear
him
tell
of
struggles
fierce
and
wild
And
when
he
died
and
left
us
to
divide
his
scanty
hoard
I
let
them
take
whate
er
they
would
but
kept
my
father
s
sword
And
with
boyish
love
I
hung
it
where
the
bright
light
used
to
shine
On
the
cottage
wall
at
Bingen
calm
Bingen
on
the
Rhine
Tell
my
sister
not
to
weep
for
me
and
sob
with
drooping
head
When
the
troops
are
marching
home
again
with
glad
and
gallant
tread
But
to
look
upon
them
proudly
with
a
calm
and
steadfast
eye
For
her
brother
was
a
soldier
too
and
not
afraid
to
die
And
if
a
comrade
seek
her
love
I
ask
her
in
my
name
To
listen
to
him
kindly
without
regret
or
shame
And
to
hang
the
old
sword
in
its
place
my
father
s
sword
and
mine
For
the
honor
of
old
Bingen
dear
Bingen
on
the
Rhine
There
s
another
not
a
sister
in
the
happy
days
gone
by
You
d
have
known
her
by
the
merriment
that
sparkled
in
her
eye
Too
innocent
for
coquetry
too
fond
for
idle
scorning
O
friend
I
fear
the
lightest
heart
makes
sometimes
heaviest
mourning
Tell
her
the
last
night
of
my
life
for
ere
this
moon
be
risen
My
body
will
be
out
of
pain
my
soul
be
out
of
prison
I
dreamed
I
stood
with
her
and
saw
the
yellow
sunlight
shine
On
the
vine
clad
hills
of
Bingen
fair
Bingen
on
the
Rhine
I
saw
the
blue
Rhine
sweep
along
I
heard
or
seemed
to
hear
The
German
songs
we
used
to
sing
in
chorus
sweet
and
clear
And
down
the
pleasant
river
and
up
the
slanting
hill
That
echoing
chorus
sounded
through
the
evening
calm
and
still
And
her
glad
blue
eyes
were
on
me
as
we
passed
with
friendly
talk
Down
many
a
path
beloved
of
yore
and
well
remembered
walk
And
her
little
hand
lay
lightly
confidingly
in
mine
But
we
ll
meet
no
more
at
Bingen
loved
Bingen
on
the
Rhine
His
voice
grew
faint
and
hoarser
his
grasp
was
childish
weak
His
eyes
put
on
a
dying
look
he
sighed
and
ceased
to
speak
His
comrade
bent
to
lift
him
but
the
spark
of
life
had
fled
The
soldier
of
the
Legion
in
a
foreign
land
was
dead
And
the
soft
moon
rose
up
slowly
and
calmly
she
looked
down
On
the
red
sand
of
the
battle
field
with
bloody
corpses
strewn
Yea
calmly
on
that
dreadful
scene
her
pale
light
seemed
to
shine
As
it
shone
on
distant
Bingen

LXXVI
CANADIAN
TREES
JAMES
BROWN
LL
D
SECOND
READING
HARD
WOODS
Let
us
now
briefly
describe
the
principal
varieties
of
our
Canadian
trees
which
lose
their
leaves
every
autumn
and
are
therefore
called
Deciduous
Trees
and
first
we
shall
begin
with
the
Oak
There
are
at
least
thirty
different
species
of
Oaks
found
in
our
Canadian
forests
all
growing
to
a
size
that
makes
them
valuable
as
timber
Most
of
them
form
noble
specimens
of
ornamental
trees
when
they
stand
out
free
and
separate
from
each
other
The
White
Oak
when
so
found
is
one
of
the
grandest
objects
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
The
seeds
of
the
Oak
which
are
called
acorns
are
found
ripe
on
the
trees
in
October
and
November
There
are
about
ten
different
species
of
Maples
found
in
our
woods
all
beautiful
and
ornamental
trees
The
Sugar
Maple
is
a
tree
of
especial
beauty
and
in
the
autumn
months
is
remarkable
for
the
brilliant
color
of
its
leaves
The
seeds
of
the
Maple
are
what
is
called
winged
They
may
be
found
lying
under
the
old
trees
in
autumn
The
Ash
is
another
valuable
Canadian
tree
and
of
this
genus
about
twenty
species
are
found
in
our
forests
All
are
more
or
less
valuable
both
for
their
timber
and
for
their
ornamental
qualities
Several
of
the
species
especially
those
called
the
White
and
the
Black
Ash
are
found
upwards
of
feet
in
height
with
diameters
close
to
the
ground
of
three
to
four
feet
through
The
timber
is
much
prized
for
its
toughness
and
strength
and
is
used
in
the
manufacture
of
implements
barrel
hoops
and
the
wood
work
of
machinery
The
Ash
is
always
found
on
deep
land
having
a
rather
damp
and
cool
bottom
The
seeds
are
ripe
in
November
and
may
then
be
gathered
from
the
trees
Of
the
Beech
there
is
only
one
species
found
in
Canada
but
here
and
there
varieties
of
it
are
to
be
met
with
caused
by
difference
of
soil
and
aspect
It
grows
to
a
large
size
when
not
closely
surrounded
by
other
trees
Its
timber
is
held
in
high
esteem
but
as
it
does
not
last
long
when
exposed
to
the
weather
it
should
therefore
be
used
for
indoor
purposes
only
The
Beech
is
not
a
long
lived
tree
as
it
becomes
matured
within
years
It
succeeds
best
on
dry
gravelly
soils
The
seeds
are
called
nuts
and
are
ripe
in
October
as
every
country
schoolboy
knows
The
Sweet
Chestnut
is
another
of
our
timber
trees
deserving
of
notice
There
is
only
one
species
of
it
to
be
found
in
Canada
and
it
is
in
all
respects
the
same
as
the
European
Sweet
Chestnut
It
is
a
majestic
tree
where
found
standing
alone
and
its
timber
is
of
a
very
durable
nature
much
sought
after
for
many
purposes
especially
for
posts
and
fence
rails
This
tree
grows
best
on
deep
dry
and
strong
land
where
it
often
reaches
a
height
of
feet
with
a
proportionate
trunk
The
seeds
are
called
nuts
and
may
be
used
as
food
The
Hornbeam
or
Ironwood
as
it
is
generally
called
in
Canada
is
a
tree
of
moderate
size
and
is
plentiful
on
the
dry
parts
of
our
forest
land
It
has
much
the
same
appearance
as
the
Beech
but
it
is
easily
distinguished
from
that
tree
by
the
curled
edges
of
its
leaves
and
by
its
darker
and
rougher
bark
The
timber
is
very
hard
of
a
close
and
compact
texture
and
is
much
used
for
farm
purposes
where
strength
is
required
The
seeds
of
this
tree
are
called
nuts
and
each
is
enclosed
in
a
peculiar
leafy
substance
called
by
botanists
a
perianth
The
Walnut
is
found
plentifully
in
most
bushes
in
the
southern
parts
of
Ontario
It
includes
nine
or
ten
species
all
growing
to
considerable
size
and
forming
very
handsome
trees
as
for
example
the
Black
Walnut
Butternut
Pecan
Nut
Hickory
Bitter
Nut
and
Hog
Nut
each
having
beautiful
foliage
The
Hickory
is
especially
known
for
the
toughness
and
other
valuable
qualities
of
its
timber
and
every
boy
is
familiar
with
the
delicious
nuts
which
this
tree
produces
All
these
trees
grow
best
on
a
deep
rich
soil
The
Plane
is
another
member
of
our
Canadian
forests
deserving
of
notice
and
is
a
tree
of
peculiar
beauty
Its
wide
spreading
branches
clothed
with
large
leaves
make
it
well
adapted
for
shelter
or
shade
In
Canada
it
is
best
known
by
the
name
of
Cotton
wood
or
Button
wood
and
is
also
familiar
as
the
Sycamore
The
British
name
for
it
is
the
Plane
Tree
It
is
found
on
deep
loamy
lands
by
the
sides
of
our
rivers
and
lakes
forming
a
tall
massive
headed
tree
often
upwards
of
feet
in
height
with
a
trunk
of
from
three
to
five
feet
in
diameter
The
timber
is
not
held
in
high
estimation
though
sometimes
used
for
furniture
making
and
for
some
parts
of
the
inner
work
of
house
building
The
tree
can
be
grown
from
cuttings
of
the
young
wood
The
Elm
in
our
woods
is
a
stately
tree
and
often
rises
to
the
height
of
feet
with
a
stem
of
six
feet
in
diameter
There
are
several
species
of
Elm
but
the
most
important
is
the
White
which
on
deep
and
cool
bottomed
land
attains
the
dimensions
stated
Where
individuals
of
this
species
stand
alone
with
all
their
limbs
fully
developed
they
form
grand
and
imposing
objects
The
timber
of
the
various
species
is
used
in
house
building
and
in
the
manufacture
of
agricultural
implements
The
seeds
ripen
in
the
early
part
of
summer
when
they
may
be
gathered
and
sown
at
once
Of
the
Birch
there
are
several
species
found
in
our
woods
but
the
Tall
Birch
and
the
Paper
Birch
are
the
most
important
and
best
known
Both
species
are
of
graceful
habit
and
foliage
The
Paper
Birch
is
particularly
remarkable
on
account
of
its
cream
colored
paper
like
bark
Both
kinds
attain
large
dimensions
in
favorable
soil
being
often
found
from
to
feet
high
with
stems
of
two
or
three
feet
in
diameter
It
is
from
the
bark
of
the
Paper
Birch
that
the
Indians
construct
their
canoes
hence
it
is
often
called
the
Canoe
Birch
The
timber
of
this
tree
enters
largely
into
the
manufacture
of
furniture
and
for
this
purpose
it
is
exported
to
Europe
The
seeds
are
contained
in
catkins
which
hang
from
the
points
of
the
branches
and
ripen
in
October
The
Tulip
may
be
easily
known
by
its
leaves
which
are
quite
unlike
those
of
almost
any
other
tree
and
much
resemble
a
riding
saddle
It
grows
to
a
large
size
and
is
highly
ornamental
its
luxuriant
foliage
together
with
its
numerous
greenish
yellow
tulip
shaped
flowers
giving
it
a
fine
appearance
The
timber
is
soft
and
of
no
especial
value
There
is
only
one
species
Of
the
Lime
we
have
four
different
species
in
our
woods
namely
the
Broad
leaved
the
Downy
leaved
the
Thin
leaved
and
the
Variable
leaved
This
tree
is
more
generally
known
to
Canadians
by
the
name
of
Basswood
All
the
species
are
graceful
trees
with
sweet
smelling
flowers
Many
of
them
grow
to
a
large
size
on
rich
deep
lands
often
attaining
the
height
of
feet
with
stems
ranging
from
three
to
five
feet
in
diameter
The
timber
is
white
and
soft
when
newly
cut
up
but
as
it
becomes
seasoned
it
acquires
firmness
of
texture
and
when
kept
dry
lasts
well
in
house
building
It
is
employed
by
shoemakers
and
saddlers
for
cutting
boards
and
is
well
suited
for
carving
purposes
LXXVII
BURIAL
OF
SIR
JOHN
MOORE
CHARLES
WOLFE
Not
a
drum
was
heard
not
a
funeral
note
As
his
corpse
to
the
rampart
we
hurried
Not
a
soldier
discharged
his
farewell
shot
O
er
the
grave
where
our
hero
we
buried
We
buried
him
darkly
at
dead
of
night
The
sods
with
our
bayonets
turning
By
the
struggling
moonbeam
s
misty
light
And
the
lantern
dimly
burning
No
useless
coffin
enclosed
his
breast
Nor
in
sheet
nor
in
shroud
we
wound
him
But
he
lay
like
a
warrior
taking
his
rest
With
his
martial
cloak
around
him
Few
and
short
were
the
prayers
we
said
And
we
spoke
not
a
word
of
sorrow
But
we
steadfastly
gazed
on
the
face
that
was
dead
And
we
bitterly
thought
of
the
morrow
We
thought
as
we
hollowed
his
narrow
bed
And
smoothed
down
his
lonely
pillow
That
the
foe
and
the
stranger
would
tread
o
er
his
head
And
we
far
away
on
the
billow
Lightly
they
ll
talk
of
the
spirit
that
s
gone
And
o
er
his
cold
ashes
upbraid
him
But
little
he
ll
reck
if
they
let
him
sleep
on
In
the
grave
where
a
Briton
has
laid
him
But
half
of
our
heavy
task
was
done
When
the
clock
struck
the
hour
for
retiring
And
we
heard
the
distant
and
random
gun
That
the
foe
was
sullenly
firing
Slowly
and
sadly
we
laid
him
down
From
the
field
of
his
fame
fresh
and
gory
We
carved
not
a
line
and
we
raised
not
a
stone
But
we
left
him
alone
with
his
glory
Phrase

We
buried
him
darkly
At
dead
of

Misty
light
Useless

Bitterly

Little

LXXVIII
THE
GOLDEN
TOUCH
NATHANIEL
HAWTHORNE
FIRST
READING
Illustration
Once
upon
a
time
there
lived
a
very
rich
man
and
a
king
besides
whose
name
was
Midas
and
he
had
a
little
daughter
whom
nobody
but
myself
ever
heard
of
and
whose
name
I
either
never
knew
or
have
entirely
forgotten
So
because
I
love
odd
names
for
little
girls
I
choose
to
call
her
Marygold
This
King
Midas
was
fonder
of
gold
than
of
any
thing
else
in
the
world
He
valued
his
royal
crown
chiefly
because
it
was
composed
of
that
precious
metal
If
he
loved
any
thing
better
or
half
so
well
it
was
the
one
little
maiden
who
played
so
merrily
around
her
father
s
footstool
But
the
more
Midas
loved
his
daughter
the
more
did
he
desire
and
seek
for
wealth
He
thought
foolish
man
that
the
best
thing
he
could
possibly
do
for
this
dear
child
would
be
to
bequeath
her
the
largest
pile
of
glistening
coin
that
had
ever
been
heaped
together
since
the
world
was
made
Thus
he
gave
all
his
thoughts
and
all
his
time
to
this
one
purpose
If
ever
he
happened
to
gaze
for
an
instant
at
the
gold
tinted
clouds
of
sunset
he
wished
that
they
were
real
gold
and
that
they
could
be
squeezed
safely
into
his
strong
box
When
little
Marygold
ran
to
meet
him
with
a
bunch
of
buttercups
and
dandelions
he
used
to
say
Pooh
pooh
child
If
these
flowers
were
as
golden
as
they
look
they
would
be
worth
the
plucking
At
length
as
people
always
grow
more
and
more
foolish
unless
they
take
care
to
grow
wiser
and
wiser
Midas
had
got
to
be
so
exceedingly
unreasonable
that
he
could
scarcely
bear
to
see
or
touch
any
object
that
was
not
gold
He
made
it
his
custom
therefore
to
pass
a
large
portion
of
every
day
in
a
dark
and
dreary
apartment
under
ground
at
the
basement
of
his
palace
It
was
here
that
he
kept
his
wealth
To
this
dismal
hole
for
it
was
little
better
than
a
dungeon
Midas
betook
himself
whenever
he
wanted
to
be
particularly
happy
Here
after
carefully
locking
the
door
he
would
take
a
bag
of
gold
coin
or
a
gold
cup
as
big
as
a
washbowl
or
a
heavy
golden
bar
or
a
peck
measure
of
gold
dust
and
bring
them
from
the
obscure
corners
of
the
room
into
the
one
bright
and
narrow
sunbeam
that
fell
from
the
dungeon
like
window
He
valued
the
sunbeam
for
no
other
reason
but
that
his
treasure
would
not
shine
without
its
help
And
then
would
he
reckon
over
the
coins
in
the
bag
toss
up
the
bar
and
catch
it
as
it
came
down
sift
the
gold
dust
through
his
fingers
look
at
the
funny
image
of
his
own
face
as
reflected
in
the
burnished
circumference
of
the
cup
and
whisper
to
himself
O
Midas
rich
King
Midas
what
a
happy
man
art
thou
Midas
was
enjoying
himself
in
his
treasure
room
one
day
as
usual
when
he
perceived
a
shadow
fall
over
the
heaps
of
gold
and
looking
up
he
beheld
the
figure
of
a
stranger
standing
in
the
bright
and
narrow
sunbeam
It
was
a
young
man
with
a
cheerful
and
ruddy
face
Whether
it
was
that
the
imagination
of
King
Midas
threw
a
yellow
tinge
over
every
thing
or
whatever
the
cause
might
be
he
could
not
help
fancying
that
the
smile
with
which
the
stranger
regarded
him
had
a
kind
of
golden
brightness
in
it
Certainly
there
was
now
a
brighter
gleam
upon
all
the
piled
up
treasures
than
before
Even
the
remotest
corners
had
their
share
of
it
and
were
lighted
up
when
the
stranger
smiled
as
with
tips
of
flame
and
sparkles
of
fire
As
Midas
knew
that
he
had
carefully
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
that
no
mortal
strength
could
possibly
break
into
his
treasure
room
he
of
course
concluded
that
his
visitor
must
be
something
more
than
mortal
Midas
had
met
such
beings
before
now
and
was
not
sorry
to
meet
one
of
them
again
The
stranger
s
aspect
indeed
was
so
good
humored
and
kindly
if
not
beneficent
that
it
would
have
been
unreasonable
to
suspect
him
of
intending
any
mischief
It
was
far
more
probable
that
he
came
to
do
Midas
a
favor
And
what
could
that
favor
be
unless
to
multiply
his
heaps
of
treasure
The
stranger
gazed
about
the
room
and
when
his
lustrous
smile
had
glistened
upon
all
the
golden
objects
that
were
there
he
turned
again
to
Midas
You
are
a
wealthy
man
friend
Midas
he
observed
I
doubt
whether
any
other
four
walls
on
earth
contain
so
much
gold
as
you
have
contrived
to
pile
up
in
this
room
I
have
done
pretty
well
pretty
well
answered
Midas
in
a
discontented
tone
But
after
all
it
is
but
a
trifle
when
you
consider
that
it
has
taken
me
my
whole
lifetime
to
get
it
together
If
one
could
live
a
thousand
years
he
might
have
time
to
grow
rich
What
exclaimed
the
stranger
Then
you
are
not
satisfied
Midas
shook
his
head
And
pray
what
would
satisfy
you
asked
the
stranger
Merely
for
the
curiosity
of
the
thing
I
should
be
glad
to
know
Midas
paused
and
meditated
He
felt
sure
that
this
stranger
with
such
a
golden
lustre
in
his
good
humored
smile
had
come
hither
with
both
the
power
and
the
purpose
of
gratifying
his
utmost
wishes
Now
therefore
was
the
fortunate
moment
when
he
had
but
to
speak
and
obtain
whatever
possible
or
seemingly
impossible
thing
it
might
come
into
his
head
to
ask
So
he
thought
and
thought
and
thought
and
heaped
up
one
golden
mountain
upon
another
in
his
imagination
without
being
able
to
imagine
them
big
enough
At
last
a
bright
idea
occurred
to
King
Midas
Raising
his
head
he
looked
the
lustrous
stranger
in
the
face
Well
Midas
observed
his
visitor
I
see
that
you
have
at
length
hit
upon
something
that
will
satisfy
you
Tell
me
your
wish
It
is
only
this
replied
Midas
I
am
weary
of
collecting
my
treasures
with
so
much
trouble
and
beholding
the
heap
so
diminutive
after
I
have
done
my
best
I
wish
every
thing
that
I
touch
to
be
changed
to
gold
The
stranger
s
smile
grew
so
bright
and
radiant
that
it
seemed
to
fill
the
room
like
an
outburst
of
the
sun
gleaming
into
a
shadowy
dell
where
the
yellow
autumnal
leaves
for
so
looked
the
lumps
and
particles
of
gold
lie
strewn
in
the
glow
of
light
The
Golden
Touch
exclaimed
he
You
certainly
deserve
credit
friend
Midas
for
striking
out
so
brilliant
a
fancy
But
are
you
quite
sure
that
this
will
satisfy
you
How
could
it
fail
said
Midas
And
will
you
never
regret
the
possession
of
it
What
could
induce
me
asked
Midas
I
ask
nothing
else
to
render
me
perfectly
happy
Be
it
as
you
wish
then
replied
the
stranger
waving
his
hand
in
token
of
farewell
To
morrow
at
sunrise
you
will
find
yourself
gifted
with
the
Golden
Touch
The
figure
of
the
stranger
then
became
exceedingly
bright
and
Midas
involuntarily
closed
his
eyes
On
opening
them
again
he
beheld
only
one
yellow
sunbeam
in
the
room
and
all
around
him
the
glistening
of
the
precious
metal
which
he
had
spent
his
life
in
hoarding
up

THE
ROOT
FIGUIER
Commit
a
seed
to
the
earth
plant
for
example
a
Lima
bean
at
the
depth
of
two
inches
in
moist
vegetable
soil
The
seed
will
not
be
slow
to
germinate
first
swelling
and
then
bursting
its
outer
skin
a
vegetable
in
miniature
will
after
a
time
slowly
reveal
itself
to
the
observer
In
the
meantime
two
very
distinct
parts
make
their
appearance
one
yellowish
in
color
already
throwing
out
slender
fibrous
shoots
sinks
farther
into
the
soil
this
is
the
radicle
or
root
the
other
of
a
pale
greenish
color
takes
the
opposite
direction
ascends
to
the
surface
and
rises
above
the
ground
this
is
the
stem
This
root
and
stem
are
the
essential
organs
of
vegetation
without
which
when
we
have
excepted
certain
vegetables
of
an
inferior
order
plants
adorned
with
leaves
and
flowers
cannot
exist
How
vast
the
difference
between
the
verdant
top
of
a
tree
which
rises
graceful
and
elegant
into
mid
air
not
to
speak
of
the
flower
it
bears
and
the
coarse
tangled
mass
of
its
roots
and
rootlets
without
harmony
without
symmetry
These
organs
so
little
favored
in
their
appearance
have
however
very
important
functions
in
the
order
of
vegetable
action
The
chief
offices
of
the
root
are
two
in
the
first
place
it
attaches
the
plant
to
the
soil
holds
it
in
its
place
and
prevents
it
from
being
overwhelmed
by
the
elements
In
the
second
it
feeds
the
plant
by
absorbing
from
the
earth
the
sap
necessary
to
its
growth
How
is
this
done
The
root
branches
again
and
again
as
it
grows
throwing
out
numerous
smaller
branches
These
hollow
thread
like
rootlets
suck
up
from
the
soil
the
water
and
other
things
which
are
to
go
through
the
stem
or
trunk
and
the
branches
to
all
the
leaves
Here
these
are
made
into
the
perfect
sap
which
being
distributed
causes
the
plant
to
grow
to
blossom
and
to
bear
fruit
The
manner
in
which
roots
succeed
in
overcoming
obstacles
has
always
been
a
subject
of
surprise
to
the
observer
The
roots
of
trees
and
shrubs
when
cramped
or
hindered
in
their
progress
have
been
observed
to
exhibit
considerable
mechanical
force
throwing
down
walls
or
splitting
rocks
in
other
cases
clinging
together
in
bunches
or
spreading
out
their
fibres
over
a
prodigious
space
in
order
to
follow
the
course
of
a
rivulet
with
its
friendly
moisture
A
celebrated
botanist
of
the
last
century
relates
that
wishing
to
preserve
a
field
of
rich
soil
from
the
roots
of
a
row
of
elms
which
would
soon
have
exhausted
it
he
had
a
ditch
dug
between
the
field
and
the
trees
in
order
to
cut
the
roots
off
from
it
But
he
saw
with
surprise
that
those
roots
which
had
not
been
severed
in
the
operation
had
made
their
way
down
the
slope
so
as
to
avoid
meeting
the
light
had
passed
under
the
ditch
and
were
again
spreading
themselves
over
the
field
There
are
some
roots
which
are
developed
along
the
stem
itself
These
supplementary
organs
come
as
helps
to
the
roots
properly
so
called
and
replace
them
when
by
any
cause
they
have
been
destroyed
In
the
primrose
for
example
both
the
principal
and
the
secondary
roots
springing
from
it
perish
after
some
years
of
growth
but
the
supplementary
roots
springing
from
the
lower
part
of
the
stalk
prevent
the
plant
from
dying
In
the
tropical
forests
of
America
and
Asia
the
vanilla
whose
fruit
is
so
sought
after
for
its
sweet
aroma
twines
its
slender
stem
round
the
neighboring
trees
forming
an
elegant
flexible
and
aerial
garland
an
ornament
in
these
vast
solitudes
at
once
grateful
and
pleasing
The
underground
roots
of
the
vanilla
would
not
be
sufficient
for
the
nutriment
of
the
plant
and
the
rising
of
the
nourishing
sap
would
take
place
too
slowly
But
Nature
makes
up
for
this
inconvenience
by
the
air
roots
which
the
plant
throws
out
at
intervals
along
its
stem
Living
in
the
warm
and
humid
atmosphere
of
tropical
forests
the
stronger
shoots
soon
reach
the
ground
and
root
themselves
in
the
soil
Others
float
freely
in
the
atmosphere
inhaling
the
moisture
and
conveying
it
to
the
parent
stem
A
grand
tree
the
banyan
or
the
pagoda
fig
tree
adorns
the
landscape
of
India
and
presents
the
most
remarkable
development
of
aerial
roots
When
the
parent
stem
has
attained
the
height
of
some
fifty
or
sixty
feet
it
throws
out
side
branches
in
every
direction
and
each
branch
in
its
turn
throws
out
supplementary
roots
which
descend
perpendicularly
in
long
slender
shoots
till
they
reach
the
ground
When
they
have
rooted
themselves
in
the
soil
they
increase
rapidly
in
diameter
and
soon
form
around
the
parent
stem
thousands
of
columns
each
throwing
out
new
lateral
branches
and
new
roots
The
bended
twigs

The
natives
love
to
build
their
temples
in
the
intervals
left
between
these
roots
of
the
wild
fig
tree
A
famous
banyan
tree
on
the
Nerbuddah
is
said
by
Professor
Forbes
to
have
three
hundred
large
and
three
thousand
smaller
aerial
roots
it
is
capable
of
sheltering
thousands
of
men
and
thus
forms
one
of
the
marvels
of
the
vegetable
world
it
is
in
short
a
forest
within
a
forest
Roots
constantly
endeavor
to
bury
themselves
in
the
earth
They
seem
to
shun
the
light
of
day
and
this
tendency
is
to
be
seen
from
the
very
first
moment
when
the
root
shows
itself
in
the
seed
The
tendency
is
so
decided
and
appears
so
inherent
in
the
life
of
all
vegetables
that
if
we
reverse
a
germinating
seed
placing
it
with
the
root
upwards
the
root
and
the
stem
will
twist
round
of
themselves
the
stem
will
stretch
upward
and
the
root
will
bury
itself
in
the
ground

SHAPES

GUSTAVUS

FIRST
READING
By
far
the
greater
number
of
plants
have
leaves
of
an
oval
shape
and
we
have
only
to
go
through
our
forests
and
gardens
to
see
them
on
every
hand
Exceedingly
varied
are
they
indeed
from
very
narrow
to
very
broad
oval
some
with
toothed
some
with
smooth
edges
and
some
even
deeply
notched
and
yet
to
such
an
extent
does
this
tendency
toward
a
rounded
form
prevail
that
there
seems
scarcely
a
plant
in
whose
leaves
a
trace
of
the
oval
may
not
be
found
The
apple
tree
gives
us
a
good
specimen
of
an
oval
leaf
and
an
immense
number
of
plants
have
leaves
resembling
it
in
shape
In
many
plants
the
leaves
are
almost
the
very
counterpart
of
those
of
the
apple
tree
in
some
they
are
narrower
and
in
others
still
narrower
till
we
come
to
very
slender
blades
like
those
of
the
grasses
and
then
beyond
still
to
the
needle
like
leaves
of
the
pines
On
the
other
hand
plants
are
to
be
found
with
leaves
broader
than
the
apple
leaf
and
so
on
rounder
and
rounder
until
we
come
to
such
plants
as
the
nasturtium
and
the
water
lily
whose
leaves
are
almost
as
round
as
circles

There
are
certainly
to
be
met
with
most
remarkable
departures
from
the
oval
shape
and
we
need
but
refer
to
such
leaves
as
those
of
the
buckwheat
to
find
that
roundness
seems
to
be
entirely
absent

BUCKWHEAT

This
style
of

glory
affords
a
familiar
example
It
will
be
noted
however
that
instead
of
the
curvilinear
flow
of

in
which
a
tendency
to
oval

is
plainly
visible
the

MORNING
GLORY
LEAF
Another
marked
characteristic
of
most
leaves
is
that
they
terminate
in
a
point
either
sharp
to
extreme
slenderness
or
blunt
to
broad
roundness
for
even
in
a
circular
leaf
there
is
one
point
which
is
its
extremity
and
to
which
the
margin
from
either
side
approaches
by
a
convexity
To
this
pointedness
of
leaves
the
exceptions
are
exceedingly
rare
A
plant
found
in
some
parts
of
our
own
country
the
magnificent
tulip
tree
presents
perhaps
the
most
extraordinary
of
all
Illustration
LEAF
OF
TULIP
TREE
Now
this
leaf
comes
out
of
a
bud
case
which
is
actually
oval
The
young
leaf
is
folded
double
inside
of
its
bud
case
and
besides
its
small
stalk
is
bent
over
so
as
to
bring
the
little
leaf
to
hold
its
end
downwards
We
can
see
this
curious
arrangement
very
well
just
after
the
bud
has
opened
and
the
young
leaf
has
come
out
However
it
soon
straightens
up
holds
its
little
head
aloft
and
looks
like
a
pretty
little
flag
After
this
it
spreads
apart
into
the
full
leaf
and
stands
up
like
a
banner
If
the
bud
be
held
up
to
the
light
the
young
leaf
can
be
seen
nicely
folded
up
inside
with
its
head
snugly
bent
down
There
is
nothing
prettier
or
more
curious
to
be
seen
in
the
woods
than
the
young
buds
of
the
tulip
trees
when
they
are
about
to
open
or
after
they
have
unfurled
their
little
flags
and
all
summer
long
even
from
earliest
spring
the
tulip
trees
are
continually
unfolding
their
buds

There
are
leaves
broader
above
than
below
and
some
instead
of
ending
in
a
point
have
a
notch
or
indentation
of
some
sort
Oak
trees
give
us
many
fine
and
varied
samples
of
notched
and
lobed
leaves
And
yet
the
leaf
of
the
chestnut
oak
is
not
at
all
notched
being
simply
ovate
pointed
and
toothed
The
leaves
of
the
bur
and
the
pin
oaks
on
the
contrary
are
lobed
and
notched
and
are
therefore
characteristic
oak
leaves
while
those
of
the
chestnut
oak
are
not
so
because
almost
all
oaks
have
leaves
more
or
less
scalloped
or
deeply
indented
Great
as
is
the
variety
in
the
shapes
of
oak
leaves
any
one
of
them
would
almost
surely
be
at
once
recognized
as
belonging
to
an
oak
tree
by
its
peculiar
scallopings
But
suppose
a
person
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
a
chestnut
oak
leaf
would
he
be
likely
to
recognize
such
a
leaf
simply
by
its
outline
There
is
still
another
oak
with
simple
leaves
and
they
are
not
even
toothed
but
entirely
smooth
all
around
the
edge
Looking
at
that
tree
which
is
called
the
willow
oak
scarcely
anyone
would
suppose
it
to
be
an
oak
unless
he
could
see
its
flowers
or
its
fruit
the
acorns

This
fact
brings
us
to
consider
a
very
important
point
in
the
study
of
a
plant
It
is
not
the
leaf
which
tells
us
what
kind
of
plant
it
is
it
is
the
flower
and
the
fruit
Whatever
be
the
shape
of
the
leaf
if
the
plant
bears
acorns
it
is
an
oak
If
a
tree
has
cherries
and
cherry
blossoms
it
is
a
cherry
It
is
true
that
in
many
families
of
plants
leaves
by
their
shape
alone
announce
at
once
the
kind
of
plant
to
which
they
belong
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
large
number
of
plants
that
cannot
be
known
by
their
leaves
but
only
by
their
flowers
and
fruits
It
is
by
flowers
and
fruits
that
plants
are
classified
and
the
more
nearly
alike
these
are
in
two
plants
the
more
closely
are
those
plants
related
The
flower
and
the
fruit
proclaim
the
nature
of
the

A

is

LXXXIV
SHAPES
OF
LEAVES
GUSTAVUS
FRANKENSTEIN
SECOND
READING
Although
the
flower
and
its
fruit
tell
us
what
the
plant
is
and
leaves
do
not
with
any
certainty
there
is
yet
a
strong
similarity
as
well
in
texture
as
in
shape
in
the
leaves
of
most
of
the
plants
comprised
within
any
one
family
Especially
in
texture
is
this
marked
similarity
observable
and
perhaps
in
most
cases
the
peculiar
structure
of
the
leaf
aside
from
its
shape
is
indicative
of
the
order
to
which
the
plant
belongs
The
leaves
of
the
grasses
are
very
much
alike
so
are
the
leaves
of
the
sedges
and
though
it
is
true
also
that
in
some
instances
a
sedge
leaf
might
be
mistaken
for
a
grass
leaf
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
sedge
family
and
the
grass
family
have
some
points
of
similarity
Again
if
we
should
come
upon
a
plant
belonging
to
the
common
potato
or
nightshade
family
we
should
be
almost
sure
to
recognize
the
family
resemblance
at
the
very
first
glance
provided
we
were
already
familiar
with
a
number
of
plants
included
in
that
order
Yet
the
leaves
of
the
nightshade
family
vary
considerably
in
shape
and
it
is
therefore
decisively
the
texture
and
peculiar
appearance
of
the
leaves
that
announce
the
kinship
of
the
plant
And
thus
we
are
led
back
to
the
consideration
of
the
willow
oak
and
chestnut
oak
leaves
which
entirely
unlike
the
typical
oak
leaf
in
shape
are
yet
very
much
like
all
other
oak
leaves
in
texture
and
other
essential
structure
Illustration
LEAF
OF
THE
ROSE
Still
more
widely
divided
than
oak
leaves
are
such
as
are
called
pinnate
in
which
the
separated
parts
are
actually
distinct
leaflets
some
even
provided
with
stalks
Such
compound
leaves
may
be
seen
in
almost
every
garden
by
looking
at
a
rose
bush
In
the
cut
we
see
what
appears
to
be
five
distinct
leaves
attached
to
one
twig
but
the
fact
is
that
they
are
only
leaflets
and
together
with
the
stalk
which
bears
them
all
constitute
but
one
complete
leaf
Each
of
these
leaflets
has
a
short
stalk
connecting
it
with
the
main
stem
which
passes
between
the
pairs
and
has
an
odd
leaflet
at
the
end
A
rose
bush
may
have
leaves
of
seven
or
nine
leaflets
Among
our
forest
trees
hickory
walnut
butternut
locust
and
ash
have
pinnate
leaves
and
on
the
honey
locust
not
only
are
the
leaves
pinnate
but
on
the
same
tree
may
also
be
found
leaves
doubly
pinnate
and
even
tripinnate
Compound
leaves
may
be
seen
also
in
the
pea
vine
which
is
simply
pinnate
but
here
the
place
of
the
absent
terminal
leaflet
is
supplied
by
a
tendril
But
if
we
examine
a
bean
plant
we
do
find
an
odd
leaf
together
with
a
pair
of
leaflets
that
is
each
leaf
is
composed
of
three
leaflets
The
many
varieties
of
bean
plants
are
all
thus
three
leaved
Besides
the
woods
are
full
of
three
leaved
plants
belonging
to
other
kinds
of
the
bean
or
pulse
order
of
plants
In
addition
to
these
and
some
others
we
must
not
overlook
a
most
extraordinary
three
leaved
plant
plentiful
in
almost
every
forest
and
on
almost
every
stone
fence
in
the
country
only
too
well
known
by
persons
who
have
been
poisoned
by
it
and
yet
not
so
well
known
by
most
people
as
it
ought
to
be
for
it
is
often
confounded
with
a
plant
having
digitate
leaves
Illustration
LEAF

POISON
VINE
Illustration
LEAF
OF
VIRGINIA
CREEPER
Here
side
by
side
the
forms
of
the
two
leaves
can
be
compared
On
the
right
is
the
digitate
leaf
of
the
beautiful
Virginia
creeper
entirely
harmless
on
the
left
is
the
pinnate
leaf
of
the
poison
vine
The
innocent
plant
is
five
leaved
the
noxious
plant
is
three
leaved
But
we
should
also
notice
particularly
that
the
arrangement
of
the
leaflets
is
quite
different
in
the
two
plants
In
the
poison
vine
we
see
a
pair
of
leaflets
and
a
terminal
odd
one
whereas
in
the
Virginia
creeper
there
is
no
pairing
of
leaflets
whatever
but
the
five
parts
radiate
from
a
centre
All
the
leaflets
come
out
together
from
one
point
at
the
tip
of
the
leaf
stalk
Plants
there
are
with
digitate
leaves
having
three
five
seven
nine
or
more
leaflets
Clover
has
digitate
leaves
of
three
leaflets
while
the
leaves
of
the
buck
eye
and
horse
chestnut
have
five
seven
and
nine
leaflets
The
pretty
little
wood
sorrel
plant
of
small
yellow
flowers
has
three
most
beautiful
inverted
heart
shaped
leaflets
radiating
from
the
tip
of
the
little
leaf
stalk
Illustration
LEAFLET
OF
WOOD
SORREL
In
leaves
like
those
of
the
maple
we
see
the
main
veins
radiating
from
a
point
at
the
top
of
the
stalk
Such
leaves
are
therefore
much
like
the
digitate
kind
only
they
are
not
completely
divided
into
separate
leaflets
Illustration
MAPLE
LEAF
Sassafras
leaves
offer
forms
something
different
On
the
same
tree
may
be
seen
oval
two
lobed
and
three
lobed
leaves
Thus
on
one
and
the
same
plant
we
see
leaves
strikingly
different
in
form
yet
the
texture
the
color
and
the
veining
are
exactly
after
the
same
pattern
in
them
all
so
that
a
sassafras
leaf
whether
oval
or
cleft
can
at
once
be
easily
known
Recalling
to
mind
the
leaf
of
the
apple
buckwheat
morning
glory
oak
rose
Virginia
creeper
maple
and
sassafras
we
have
pretty
good
models
after
which
nearly
all
leaves
are
built
approximating
to
one
or
other
of
these
with
certain
variations
peculiar
to
the
species
Another
important
matter
regarding
the
leaves
of
plants
is
their
relative
position
on
the
stems
There
are
two
principal
and
very
marked
arrangements
of
leaves
Leaves
are
either
opposite
one
another
on
the
stem
or
they
are
alternate
or
not
opposite
There
are
whole
orders
of
plants
with
none
but
opposite
leaves
as
the
mint
family
In
other
orders
the
leaves
of
every
plant
are
alternate
And
again
in
some
orders
and
even
on
the
same
plants
are
found
both
opposite
and
alternate
leaves
as
in
the
composite
or
sunflower
family
and
a
single
wild
sunflower
plant
itself
has
opposite
leaves
below
and
alternate
leaves
above
Of
our
forest
trees
there
are
very
few
species
with
opposite
leaves
If
you
see
that
the
branches
and
leaves
of
a
tree
do
not
stand
one
opposite
another
on
the
stem
you
can
at
once
be
sure
that
it
is
not
an
ash
a
maple
or
a
buck
eye
because
all
these
trees
do
have
opposite
leaves
On
the
other
hand
there
are
many
trees
having
alternate
branches
and
leaves
such
as
the
oak
chestnut
elm
hickory
walnut
butternut
tulip
tree
alder
beech
birch
poplar
willow
mulberry
linden
locust
and
others

On

In

There

And
no

And
no

For

upturned

And
laid

there
That
was
the

funeral
That
ever

But
no
man
heard
the
trampling
Or
saw
the

go
forth
Noiselessly

Comes
when

And
the

Grows
into

Noiselessly
as

Her

And
all
the

on
all
the

Open
their

So
without
sound
of
music
Or
voice
of
them
that
wept
Silently
down
from
the
mountain

The
great
procession
swept
Perchance
the
bald
old
eagle
On
gray
Beth

s
height
Out
of
his
lonely
eyrie
Looked
on
the
wondrous
sight
Perchance
the
lion
stalking
Still
shuns
that
hallowed
spot
For
beast
and
bird
have
seen
and
heard
That
which
man
knoweth
not
But
when
the
warrior
dieth
His
comrades
in
the
war
With
arms
reversed
and
muffled
drum
Follow
his
funeral
car
They
show
the
banners
taken
They
tell
his
battles
won
And
after
him
lead
his
masterless
steed
While
peals
the
minute
gun
Amid
the
noblest
of
the
land
We
lay
the
sage
to
rest
And
give
the
bard
an
honored
place
With
costly
marble
dressed
In
the
great
minster
transept
Where
lights
like
glories
fall
And
the
sweet
choir
sings
and
the
organ
rings
Along
the
emblazoned
wall
This
was
the
bravest
warrior
That
ever
buckled
sword
This
the
most
gifted
poet
That
ever
breathed
a
word
And
never
earth
s
philosopher
Traced
with
his
golden
pen
On
the
deathless
page
truths
half
so
sage
As
he
wrote
down
for
men
And
had
he
not
high
honor
The
hill
side
for
his
pall
To
lie
in
state
while
angels
wait
With
stars
for
tapers
tall
And
the
dark
rock
pines
like
tossing
plumes
Over
his
bier
to
wave
And
God
s
own
hand
in
that
lonely
land
To
lay
him
in
the
grave
In
that
strange
grave
without
a
name
Whence
his
uncoffined
clay
Shall
break
again
O
wondrous
thought
Before
the
Judgment
day
And
stand
with
glory
wrapped
around
On
the
hills
he
never
trod
And
speak
of
the
strife
that
won
our
life
With
the
Incarnate
Son
of

O

O

Speak

it

his
astonishment
and
delight
when
he
found
that
this
linen
fabric
had
been
transmuted
to
what
seemed
a
woven
texture
of
the
purest
and
brightest
gold
The
Golden
Touch
had
come
to
him
with
the
first
sunbeam
Midas
started
up
in
a
kind
of
joyful
frenzy
and
ran
about
the
room
grasping
at
every
thing
that
happened
to
be
in
his
way
He
seized
one
of
the
bedposts
and
it
became
immediately
a
fluted
golden
pillar
He
pulled
aside
a
window
curtain
in
order
to
admit
a
clear
spectacle
of
the
wonders
which
he
was
performing
and
the
tassel
grew
heavy
in
his
hand
a
mass
of
gold
He
took
up
a
book
from
the
table
at
his
first
touch
it
assumed
the
appearance
of
such
a
splendidly
bound
and
gilt
edged
volume
as
one
often
meets
with
now
a
days
but
on
running
his
fingers
through
the
leaves
behold
it
was
a
bundle
of
thin
golden
plates
in
which
all
the
wisdom
of
the
book
had
grown
illegible
He
hurriedly
put
on
his
clothes
and
was
enraptured
to
see
himself
in
a
magnificent
suit
of
gold
cloth
which
retained
its
flexibility
and
softness
although
it
burdened
him
a
little
with
its
weight
He
drew
out
his
handkerchief
which
little
Marygold
had
hemmed
for
him
that
was
likewise
gold
with
the
dear
child
s
neat
and
pretty
stitches
running
all
along
the
border
in
gold
thread
Somehow
or
other
this
last
transformation
did
not
quite
please
King
Midas
He
would
rather
that
his
little
daughter
s
handiwork
should
have
remained
just
the
same
as
when
she
climbed
his
knee
and
put
it
into
his
hand
But
it
was
not
worth
while
to
vex
himself
about
a
trifle
Midas
took
his
spectacles
from
his
pocket
and
put
them
on
his
nose
in
order
that
he
might
see
more
distinctly
what
he
was
about
In
those
days
spectacles
for
common
people
had
not
been
invented
but
were
already
worn
by
kings
else
how
could
Midas
have
had
any
To
his
great
perplexity
however
excellent
as
the
glasses
were
he
discovered
that
he
could
not
possibly
see
through
them
But
this
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
for
on
taking
them
off
the
transparent
crystals
turned
out
to
be
plates
of
yellow
metal
and
of
course
were
worthless
as
spectacles
though
valuable
as
gold
It
struck
Midas
as
rather
inconvenient
that
with
all
his
wealth
he
could
never
again
be
rich
enough
to
own
a
pair
of
serviceable
spectacles
It
is
no
great
matter
nevertheless
said
he
to
himself
Very
philosophically
We
can
not
expect
any
great
good
without
its
being
accompanied
with
some
small
inconvenience
The
Golden
Touch
is
worth
the
sacrifice
of
a
pair
of
spectacles
at
least
if
not
of
one
s
very
eyesight
My
own
eyes
will
serve
for
ordinary
purposes
and
little
Marygold
will
soon
be
old
enough
to
read
to
me
Wise
King
Midas
was
so
exalted
by
his
good
fortune
that
the
palace
seemed
not
sufficiently
spacious
to
contain
him
He
therefore
went
down
stairs
and
smiled
on
observing
that
the
balustrade
of
the
staircase
became
a
bar
of
burnished
gold
as
his
hand
passed
over
it
in
his
descent
He
lifted
the
door
latch
it
was
brass
only
a
moment
ago
but
golden
when
his
fingers
quitted
it
and
emerged
into
the
garden
Here
as
it
happened
he
found
a
great
number
of
beautiful
roses
in
full
bloom
and
others
in
all
the
stages
of
lovely
bud
and
blossom
Very
delicious
was
their
fragrance
in
the
morning
breeze
Their
delicate
blush
was
one
of
the
fairest
sights
in
the
world
so
gentle
so
modest
and
so
full
of
sweet
soothing
did
these
roses
seem
to
be
But
Midas
knew
a
way
to
make
them
far
more
precious
according
to
his
way
of
thinking
than
roses
had
ever
been
before
So
he
took
great
pains
in
going
from
bush
to
bush
and
exercised
his
magic
touch
most
untiringly
until
every
individual
flower
and
bud
and
even
the
worms
at
the
heart
of
some
of
them
were
changed
to
gold
By
the
time
this
good
work
was
completed
King
Midas
was
summoned
to
breakfast
and
as
the
morning
air
had
given
him
an
excellent
appetite
he
made
haste
back
to
the
palace
What
was
usually
a
king
s
breakfast
in
the
days
of
Midas
I
really
do
not
know
and
can
not
stop
now
to
investigate
To
the
best
of
my
knowledge
however
on
this
particular
morning
the
breakfast
consisted
of
hot
cakes
some
nice
little
brook
trout
roasted
potatoes
fresh
boiled
eggs
and
coffee
for
King
Midas
himself
and
a
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
for
his
daughter
Marygold
Little
Marygold
had
not
yet
made
her
appearance
Her
father
ordered
her
to
be
called
and
seating
himself
at
table
awaited
the
child
s
coming
in
order
to
begin
his
own
breakfast
To
do
Midas
justice
he
really
loved
his
daughter
and
loved
her
so
much
the
more
this
morning
on
account
of
the
good
fortune
which
had
befallen
him
It
was
not
a
great
while
before
he
heard
her
coming
along
the
passage
crying
bitterly
This
circumstance
surprised
him
because
Marygold
was
one
of
the
most
cheerful
little
people
whom
you
would
see
in
a
summer
s
day
and
hardly
shed
a
tear
in
a
twelvemonth
When
Midas
heard
her
sobs
he
determined
to
put
little
Marygold
into
better
spirits
by
an
agreeable
surprise
so
leaning
across
the
table
he
touched
his
daughter
s
bowl
which
was
a
china
one
with
pretty
figures
all
around
it
and
changed
it
into
gleaming
gold
Meanwhile
Marygold
slowly
and
sadly
opened
the
door
and
showed
herself
with
her
apron
at
her
eyes
still
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
How
now
my
little
lady
cried
Midas
Pray
what
is
the
matter
with
you
this
bright
morning
Marygold
without
taking
the
apron
from
her
eyes
held
out
her
hand
in
which
was
one
of
the
roses
which
Midas
had
so
recently
changed
into
gold
Beautiful
exclaimed
her
father
And
what
is
there
in
this
magnificent
golden
rose
to
make
you
cry
Ah
dear
father
answered
the
child
between
her
sobs
it
is
not
beautiful
but
the
ugliest
flower
that
ever
grew
As
soon
as
I
was
dressed
I
ran
into
the
garden
to
gather
some
roses
for
you
because
I
know
you
like
them
and
like
them
the
better
when
gathered
by
your
little
daughter
But
oh
dear
dear
me
What
do
you
think
has
happened
Such
a
sad
thing
All
the
beautiful
roses
that
smelled
so
sweetly
and
had
so
many
lovely
blushes
are
blighted
and
spoilt
They
are
grown
quite
yellowy
as
you
see
this
one
and
have
no
longer
any
fragrance
What
can
have
been
the
matter
with
them
Pooh
my
dear
little
girl
pray
don
t
cry
about
it
said
Midas
who
was
ashamed
to
confess
that
he
himself
had
wrought
the
change
which
so
greatly
afflicted
her
Sit
down
and
eat
your
bread
and
milk
You
will
find
it
easy
enough
to
exchange
a
golden
rose
like
that
which
will
last
hundreds
of
years
for
an
ordinary
one
which
would
wither
in
a
day
I
don
t
care
for
such
roses
as
this
cried
Marygold
tossing
it
contemptuously
away
It
has
no
smell
and
the
hard
petals
prick
my
nose
The
child
now
sat
down
to
table
but
was
so
occupied
with
her
grief
for
the
blighted
roses
that
she
did
not
even
notice
the
wonderful
change
in
her
china
bowl
Perhaps
this
was
all
the
better
for
Marygold
was
accustomed
to
take
pleasure
in
looking
at
the
queer
figures
and
strange
trees
and
houses
that
were
painted
on
the
outside
of
the
bowl
and
those
ornaments
were
now
entirely
lost
in
the
yellow
hue
of
the
metal
Midas
meanwhile
had
poured
out
a
cup
of
coffee
and
as
a
matter
of
course
the
coffee
pot
whatever
metal
it
may
have
been
when
he
took
it
up
was
gold
when
he
set
it
down
He
thought
to
himself
that
it
was
rather
an
extravagant
style
of
splendor
in
a
king
of
his
simple
habits
to
breakfast
off
a
service
of
gold
and
began
to
be
puzzled
with
the
difficulty
of
keeping
his
treasures
safe
The
cupboard
and
the
kitchen
would
no
longer
be
a
secure
place
of
deposit
for
articles
so
valuable
as
golden
bowls
and
golden
coffee
pots
Amid
these
thoughts
he
lifted
a
spoonful
of
coffee
to
his
lips
and
sipping
it
was
astonished
to
perceive
that
the
instant
his
lips
touched
the
liquid
it
became
molten
gold
and
the
next
moment
hardened
into
a
lump
Ha
exclaimed
Midas
rather
aghast
What
is
the
matter
father
asked
little
Marygold
gazing
at
him
with
the
tears
still
standing
in
her
eyes
Nothing
child
nothing
said
Midas
Take
your
milk
before
it
gets
quite
cold
He
took
one
of
the
nice
little
trouts
on
his
plate
and
touched
its
tail
with
his
finger
To
his
horror
it
was
immediately
changed
from
a
brook
trout
into
a
gold
fish
and
looked
as
if
it
had
been
very
cunningly
made
by
the
nicest
goldsmith
in
the
world
Its
little
bones
were
now
golden
wires
its
fins
and
tail
were
thin
plates
of
gold
and
there
were
the
marks
of
the
fork
in
it
and
all
the
delicate
frothy
appearance
of
a
nicely
fried
fish
exactly
imitated
in
metal
I
don
t
quite
see
thought
he
to
himself
how
I
am
to
get
any
breakfast
He
took
one
of
the
smoking
hot
cakes
and
had
scarcely
broken
it
when
to
his
cruel
mortification
though
a
moment
before
it
had
been
of
the
whitest
wheat
it
assumed
the
yellow
hue
of
Indian
meal
Its
solidity
and
increased
weight
made
him
too
bitterly
sensible
that
it
was
gold
Almost
in
despair
he
helped
himself
to
a
boiled
egg
which
immediately
underwent
a
change
similar
to
that
of
the
trout
and
the
cake
Well
this
is
terrible
thought
he
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
looking
quite
enviously
at
little
Marygold
who
was
now
eating
her
bread
and
milk
with
great
satisfaction
Such
a
costly
breakfast
before
me
and
nothing
that
can
be
eaten
Hoping
that
by
dint
of
great
dispatch
he
might
avoid
what
he
now
felt
to
be
a
considerable
inconvenience
King
Midas
next
snatched
a
hot
potato
and
attempted
to
cram
it
into
his
mouth
and
swallow
it
in
a
hurry
But
the
Golden
Touch
was
too
nimble
for
him
He
found
his
mouth
full
not
of
mealy
potato
but
of
solid
metal
which
so
burnt
his
tongue
that
he
roared
aloud
and
jumping
up
from
the
table
began
to
dance
and
stamp
about
the
room
both
with
pain
and
affright
Father
dear
father
cried
little
Marygold
who
was
a
very
affectionate
child
pray
what
is
the
matter
Have
you
burnt
your
mouth
Ah
dear
child
groaned
Midas
dolefully
I
don
t
know
what
is
to
become
of
your
poor
father
Oh
many
a
shaft
at
random
sent
Finds
mark
the
archer
little
meant
And
many
a
word
at
random
spoken
May
soothe
or
wound
a
heart
that

LXXXVIII
THE
FLOWER
Why
comes
the
flower
upon
the
plant
That
fruit
may
come
And
why
the
fruit
That
it
may
hold
protect
and
cherish
the
seed
And
why
the
seed
That
the
plant
may
have
offspring
that
other
plants
may
grow
up
and
be
as
near
like
itself
as
one
living
thing
can
well
be
like
another
The
flower
is
the
beginning
of
the
seed
the
first
step
toward
reproduction
and
the
fruit
is
the
flower
completed
If
it
does
throw
aside
its
floral
ornaments
its
petals
or
other
adorning
or
useful
parts
of
its
blooming
period
it
still
retains
the
maturing
seed
and
ends
in
the
ripened
fruit
Look
inside
of
almost
any
flower
and
you
will
see
embosomed
in
its
petals
the
thread
like
organs
called
stamens
with
little
yellow
knobs
at
their
ends
Shake
them
if
they
are
ripe
they
will
give
up
the
fine
dust
or
pollen
so
light
that
the
breeze
will
blow
it
away
Some
flowers
have
few
stamens
some
have
many
and
of
the
latter
the
apple
and
cherry
blossoms
afford
examples
Most
of
the
different
grasses
have
three
stamens
to
each
of
their
little
flowers
For
example
a
head
of
timothy
grass
has
a
long
thick
bunch
of
flowers
crowded
together
at
the
top
of
the
slender
stem
Early
in
the
summer
about
June
you
may
see
the
little
stamens
peeping
out
all
around
three
of
them
together
and
their
little
golden
knobs
dangling
in
the
breeze
Some
plants
have
only
two
stamens
on
a
flower
and
there
is
a
water
plant
called
the
mare
s
tail
with
only
one
stamen
A
few
flowers
indeed
are
wholly
destitute
of
this
organ
Besides
the
stamens
there
are
also
in
most
flowers
other
threads
stems
or
knobs
somewhat
like
the
stamens
but
generally
of
a
different
color
These
pistils
as
they
are
called
have
their
place
in
the
centre
of
the
flower
whilst
the
stamens
stand
around
them
Unlike
the
stamens
the
pistils
have
no
pollen
but
it
is
on
the
latter
that
the
pollen
must
fall
in
order
that
the
plant
may
bear
seed
It
is
in
the
bottom
of
the
pistils
that
the
seeds
grow
but
there
will
be
no
seed
unless
the
dust
or
pollen
from
the
stamens
falls
on
the
pistils
Most
plants
bear
flowers
that
have
both
stamens
and
pistils
Such
flowers
are
called
perfect
flowers
But
there
are
also
plants
that
have
two
kinds
of
flowers
in
some
of
which
are
stamens
only
and
in
the
others
pistils
only
Again
there
are
plants
some
of
which
have
flowers
with
stamens
only
and
others
of
which
have
flowers
with
pistils
only
The
willow
trees
are
such
plants
Of
the
five
senses
flowers
address
themselves
most
feelingly
to
two
In
delighting
the
sense
of
smell
they
stand
pre
eminent
almost
alone
Does
true
fragrance
ever
come
from
anything
but
a
plant
and
are
not
flowers
especially
the
generous
dispensers
of
grateful
odors
And
to
the
eye
what
wealth
of
beauty
do
they
unfold
We
need
think
of
no
more
than
the
lily
the
pink
and
the
rose
Was
anything
ever
arrayed
like
one
of
these
When
we
look
upon
them
they
fill
the
heart
with
joy
We
smell
of
them
and
exclaim
that
their
fragrance
exceeds
even
their
beauty
Again
we
look
upon
them
and
now
we
aver
that
their
beauty
surpasses
their
perfume

SECOND
READING
If
you
re
waking
call
me
early
call
me
early
mother
dear
For
I
would
see
the
sun
rise
upon
the
glad
New
year
It
is
the
last
New
year
that
I
shall
ever
see
Then
you
may
lay
me
low
i
the
mould
and
think
no
more
of
me
To
night
I
saw
the
sun
set
he
set
and
left
behind
The
good
old
year
the
dear
old
time
and
all
my
peace
of
mind
And
the
New
year
s
coming
up
mother
but
I
shall
never
see
The
blossom
on
the
blackthorn
the
leaf
upon
the
tree
Last
May
we
made
a
crown
of
flowers
we
had
a
merry
day
Beneath
the
hawthorn
on
the
green
they
made
me
Queen
of
May
And
we
danced
about
the
May
pole
and
in
the
hazel
copse
Till
Charles
s
Wain
came
out
above
the
tall
white
chimney
tops
There
s
not
a
flower
on
all
the
hills
the
frost
is
on
the
pane
I
only
wish
to
live
till
the
snow
drops
come
again
I
wish
the
snow
would
melt
and
the
sun
come
out
on
high
I
long
to
see
a
flower
so
before
the
day
I
die
The
building
rook
ill
caw
from
the
windy
tall
elm
tree
And
the
tufted
plover
pipe
along
the
fallow
lea
And
the
swallow
ill
come
back
again
with
summer
o
er
the
wave
But
I
shall
lie
alone
mother
within
the
mouldering
grave
Upon
the
chancel
casement
and
upon
that
grave
of
mine
In
the
early
early
morning
the
summer
sun
ill
shine
Before
the
red
cock
crows
from
the
farm
upon
the
hill
When
you
are
warm
asleep
mother
and
all
the
world
is
still
When
the
flowers
come
again
mother
beneath
the
waning
light
You
ll
never
see
me
more
in
the
long
gray
fields
at
night
When
from
the
dry
dark
wold
the
summer
airs
blow
cool
On
the
oat
grass
and
the
sword
grass
and
the
bulrush
in
the
pool
You
ll
bury
me
my
mother
just
beneath
the
hawthorn
shade
And
you
ll
come
sometimes
and
see
me
where
I
am
lowly
laid
I
shall
not
forget
you
mother
I
shall
hear
you
when
you
pass
With
your
feet
above
my
head
in
the
long

I
have
been
wild
and
wayward
but
you

forgive
me
now
You

my

mother
and
forgive
me
ere
I

Nay
nay
you
must

nor

your
grief
be

You

If
I

I

mother
from

Tho
you

mother
I

look
upon

Tho
I
cannot

I
shall
hearken
what
you
say
And
be
often
often
with
you
when
you
think
I

Good

good
night
when
I
have
said
good
night
forevermore
And
you
see
me
carried
out
from
the
threshold
of
the
door
Don
t
let
Effie
come
to
see
me
till
my

She

be
a
better
child
to
you
than

I

She

Let

I

But

to

the

About

All

I

But

XC
THE
FRUIT
GUSTAVUS
FRANKENSTEIN
It
is
not
alone
the
delicious
grape
the
grateful
apple
the
luscious
pear
the
clustered
cherries
the
tart
currants
the
golden
orange
the
sweet
blackberries
the
refreshing
melon
the
blooming
peach
the
purple
plum
the
sun
fed
strawberries
or
whatever
other
products
of
the
plants
we
may
deem
good
to
eat
that
are
entitled
to
the
name
of
fruit
The
very
mention
the
very
thought
of
fruit
brings
to
our
minds
an
ever
welcome
idea
of
something
not
only
wholesome
and
pleasing
to
the
taste
but
at
the
same
time
beautiful
for
all
fertile
flowers
on
whatever
plant
they
may
grow
merge
eventually
into
fruit
That
fruit
may
not
be
edible
it
may
be
bitter
it
may
be
sour
it
may
be
as
dry
as
a
chip
or
it
may
even
be
poisonous
still
it
is
fruit
It
is
fruit
to
the
plant
if
not
to
us
The
seed
we
may
say
is
the
infant
offspring
of
the
plant
by
means
of
which
in
the
course
of
nature
it
perpetuates
its
kind
The
flower
is
the
first
step
in
the
formation
of
the
fruit
The
plant
opens
to
the
sunshine
a
charming
expression
of
form
and
color
in
the
budding
flower
Nursing
in
its
bosom
the
growing
germ
the
flower
usually
sheds
its
gay
attire
throws
off
its
petals
its
ribbons
and
its
tassels
and
in
a
sober
motherly
way
devotes
itself
to
the
one
great
task
of
cherishing
perfecting
and
guarding
the
seed
In
fact
the
flower
which
at
first
seemed
but
a
transport
of
joy
now
shorn
of
its
bridal
ornaments
has
become
the
substantial
fruit
That
fruit
is
the
guardian
of
the
seed
within
which
sleeps
the
infant
plant
and
according
to
the
needs
of
that
seed
will
the
fruit
be
fashioned
Are
the
seeds
to
be
carried
far
and
wide
ten
to
one
the
fruit
is
furnished
with
a
plume
a
sail
or
a
wing
by
which
to
be
wafted
through
the
air
or
with
hooks
to
cling
to
passing
animals
or
with
some
other
contrivance
to
effect
conveyance
Or
if
the
seed
inside
be
provided
with
a
sail
the
fruit
will
open
and
let
the
little
seed
go
forth
and
seek
its
fortune
by
itself
Endless
are
the
expedients
by
which
the
seed
and
the
fruit
seek
to
perpetuate
the
kind
of
plant
from
which
they
spring
We
may
look
at
the
well
known
fruit
head
of
the
dandelion
which
is
the
prettiest
little
airy
like
silken
ball
that
can
be
imagined
Doubtless
it
has
not
occurred
to
everybody
what
this
beautiful
sphere
so
common
in
the
meadows
and
by
the
road
sides
really
is
Previous
to
this
sphere
and
in
the
place
of
it
was
the
flower
the
well
known
yellow
dandelion
which
belongs
to
the
composite
family
Illustration
DANDELION
HEAD
The
dandelion
is
not
really
one
flower
but
a
circled
group
of
many
small
flowers
or
florets
These
are
surrounded
by
an
outer
circle
of
green
leaflets
which
bend
down
when
the
florets
have
changed
into
fruits
allowing
them
to
radiate
in
every
direction
from
the
core
in
the
centre
The
whole
ball
is
made
up
of
many
small
fruits
each
of
which
is
a
single
seed
enclosed
in
a
thin
cover
surmounted
by
an
elevated
circled
plume
Blow
on
this
lovely
little
sphere
and
away
will
fly
the
little
tufted
fruits
some
one
way
and
some
another
If
there
is
any
breeze
stirring
there
is
no
knowing
how
far
they
will
go
It
is
not
strange
then
that
dandelions
spring
up
almost
everywhere
See
what
a
vast
number
of
fruits
must
go
sailing
about
all
over
the
country
on
a
dry
midsummer
s
day
It
is
true
not
half
of
them
grow
up
into
plants
to
make
more
dandelions
but
a
great
many
of
them
do
In
the
same
way
the
beautiful
asters
of
our
woods
with
their
flowers
of
yellow
or
purplish
disks
and
lovely
rays
of
white
or
purple
as
large
as
roses
let
their
little
fruits
fly
away
from
their
heads
as
soon
as
ripe
and
dry
There
are
about
as
many
different
kinds
of
fruits
as
there
are
of
flowers
The
plants
of
the
bean
family
for
instance
have
fruits
like
the
bean
pods
These
pods
when
ripe
and
dry
split
open
at
the
two
edges
and
then
the
beans
or
seeds
drop
out
Do
you
know
the
pods
of
the
honey
locust
trees
large
broad
thin
and
sweet
Clover
too
belongs
to
the
bean
family
You
can
find
the
tiny
pods
in
the
dry
heads
of
clover
if
you
will
pick
out
the
little
withered
flowers
and
open
them
Some
fruits
have
a
kind
of
wings
Such
are
the
fruits
of
our
beautiful
maple
tree
and
very
pretty
are
these
maple
keys
as
they
are
called
when
they
hang
in
clusters
from
the
branches
and
dangle
among
the
leaves
At
the
end
where
they
are
joined
there
is
in
each
key
a
thick
hard
round
swelling
in
which
is
the
seed
When
the
fruit
is
ripe
and
dry
it
falls
off
and
we
may
often
see
the
pair
of
keys
flying
away
together
As
they
are
light
they
go
whirling
in
the
wind
sometimes
to
a
great
distance
The
fruit
of
the
ash
tree
looks
like
that
of
the
maple
and
also
hangs
in
bunches
but
each
fruit
is
a
single
key
These
are
but
a
few
of
the
many
kinds
of
fruits
to
be
found
on
plants
each
in
itself
a
curiosity
and
a
beauty
and
how
much
we
fairly
owe
to
them
is
scarcely
ever
in
our
thoughts
If
we
consider
but
wheat
alone
how
valuable
to
us
is
its
little
fruit
the
simple
grain
to
say
nothing
of
the
fruits
of
other
grasses
such
as
rice
rye
oats
and
the
large
and
generous
ears
of
Indian
corn
Nor
must
the
cotton
plant
be
forgotten
whose
fruit
does
not
indeed
feed
but
clothes
our
bodies
enters
into
countless
uses
in
every
household
is
indispensable
on
every
craft
that
sails
the
sea
and
inseparable
from
so
many
industries
on
land
and

The
fruit
of
the
cotton
plant
is
a
pod
which
bursting
open
reveals
a
mass
of
white
woolly
fibres
enveloping
and

to
the

READING
Illustration
I
thought
to
pass
away
before
and
yet
alive
I
am
And
in
the
fields
all
round
I
hear
the
bleating
of
the
lamb
How
sadly
I
remember
rose
the
morning
of
the
year
To
die
before
the
snowdrop
came
and
now
the
violet
s
here
O
sweet
is
the
new
violet
that
comes
beneath
the
skies
And
sweeter
is
the
young
lamb
s
voice
to
me
that
cannot
rise
And
sweet
is
all
the
land
about
and
all
the
flowers
that
blow
And
sweeter
far
is
death
than
life
to
me
that
long
to
go
It
seemed
so
hard
at
first
mother
to
leave
the
blessed
sun
And
now
it
seems
as
hard
to
stay
and
yet
His
will
be
done
But
still
I
think
it
can
t
be
long
before
I
find
release
And
that
good
man
the
clergyman
has
told
me
words
of
peace
O
blessings
on
his
kindly
voice
and
on
his
silver
hair
And
blessings
on
his
whole
life
long
until
he
meet
me
there
O
blessings
on
his
kindly
heart
and
on
his
silver
head
A
thousand
times
I
blessed
him
as
he
knelt
beside
my
bed
He
taught
me
all
the
mercy
for
he
showed
me
all
the
sin
Now
tho
my
lamp
was
lighted
late
there
s
One
will
let
me
in
Nor
would
I
now
be
well
mother
again
if
that
could
be
For
my
desire
is
but
to
pass
to
Him
that
died
for
me
I
did
not
hear
the
dog
howl
mother
or
the
death
watch
beat
There
came
a
sweeter
token
when
the
night
and
morning
meet
But
sit
beside
my
bed
mother
and
put
your
hand
in
mine
And
Effie
on
the
other
side
and
I
will
tell
the
sign
All
in
the
wild
March
morning
I
heard
the
angels
call
It
was
when
the
moon
was
setting
and
the
dark
was
over
all
The
trees
began
to
whisper
and
the
wind
began
to
roll
And
in
the
wild
March
morning
I
heard
them
call
my
soul
For
lying
broad
awake
I
thought
of
you
and
Effie
dear
I
saw
you
sitting
in
the
house
and
I
no
longer
here
With
all
my
strength
I
prayed
for
both
and
so
I
felt
resigned
And
up
the
valley
came
a
swell
of
music
on
the
wind
I
thought
that
it
was
fancy
and
I
listened
in
my
bed
And
then
did
something
speak
to
me
I
know
not
what
was
said
For
great
delight
and
shuddering
took
hold
of
all
my
mind
And
up
the
valley
came
again
the
music
on
the
wind
But
you
were
sleeping
and
I
said
It
s
not
for
them
it
s
mine
And
if
it
comes
three
times
I
thought
I
take
it
for
a
sign
And
once
again
it
came
and
close
beside
the
window
bars
Then
seemed
to
go
right
up
to
Heaven
and
die
among
the
stars
So
now
I
think
my
time
is
near
I
trust
it
is
I
know
The
blessed
music
went
that
way
my
soul
will
have
to
go
And
for
myself
indeed
I
care
not
if
I
go
to
day
But
Effie
you
must
comfort
her
when
I
am
past
away
And
say
to
Robin
a
kind
word
and
tell
him
not
to
fret
There
s
many
worthier
than
I
would
make
him
happy
yet
If
I
had
lived
I
cannot
tell
I
might
have
been
his
wife
But
all
these
things
have
ceased
to
be
with
my
desire
of
life
O
look
the
sun
begins
to
rise
the
heavens
are
in
a
glow
He
shines
upon
a
hundred
fields
and
all
of
them
I
know
And
there
I
move
no
longer
now
and
there
his
light
may
shine
Wild
flowers
in
the
valley
for
other
hands
than
mine
O
sweet
and
strange
it
seems
to
me
that
ere
this
day
is
done
The
voice
that
now
is
speaking
may
be
beyond
the
sun
For
ever
and
for
ever
with
those
just
souls
and
true
And
what
is
life
that
we
should
moan
why
make
we
such
ado
For
ever
and
forever
all
in
a
blessed
home
And
there
to
wait
a
little
while
till
you
and
Effie
come
To
lie
within
the
light
of
God
as
I
lie
upon
your
breast
And
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
XCII
THE
GOLDEN
TOUCH
NATHANIEL
HAWTHORNE
THIRD
READING
And
truly
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
pitiable
case
in
all
your
lives
Here
was
literally
the
richest
breakfast
that
could
be
set
before
a
king
and
its
very
richness
made
it
absolutely
good
for
nothing
The
poorest
laborer
sitting
down
to
his
crust
of
bread
and
cup
of
water
was
far
better
off
than
King
Midas
whose
delicate
food
was
really
worth
its
weight
in
gold
And
what
was
to
be
done
Already
at
breakfast
Midas
was
excessively
hungry
Would
he
be
less
so
by
dinner
time
And
how
ravenous
would
be
his
appetite
for
supper
which
must
undoubtedly
consist
of
the
same
sort
of
indigestible
dishes
as
those
now
before
him
How
many
days
think
you
would
he
survive
a
continuance
of
this
rich
fare
These
reflections
so
troubled
wise
King
Midas
that
he
began
to
doubt
whether
after
all
riches
are
the
one
desirable
thing
in
the
world
or
even
the
most
desirable
But
this
was
only
a
passing
thought
So
fascinated
was
Midas
with
the
glitter
of
the
yellow
metal
that
he
would
still
have
refused
to
give
up
the
Golden
Touch
for
so
paltry
a
consideration
as
a
breakfast
Just
imagine
what
a
price
for
one
meal
s
victuals
It
would
have
been
the
same
as
paying
millions
and
millions
of
money
for
some
fried
trout
an
egg
a
potato
a
hot
cake
and
a
cup
of
coffee
It
would
be
much
too
dear
thought
Midas
Nevertheless
so
great
was
his
hunger
and
the
perplexity
of
his
situation
that
he
again
groaned
aloud
and
very
grievously
too
Our
pretty
Marygold
could
endure
it
no
longer
She
sat
a
moment
gazing
at
her
father
and
trying
with
all
the
might
of
her
little
wits
to
find
out
what
was
the
matter
with
him
Then
with
a
sweet
and
sorrowful
impulse
to
comfort
him
she
started
from
her
chair
and
running
to
Midas
threw
her
arms
affectionately
about
his
knees
He
bent
down
and
kissed
her
He
felt
that
his
little
daughter
s
love
was
worth
a
thousand
times
more
than
he
had
gained
by
the
Golden
Touch
My
precious
precious
Marygold
cried
he
But
Marygold
made
no
answer
Alas
what
had
he
done
How
fatal
was
the
gift
which
the
stranger
had
bestowed
The
moment
the
lips
of
Midas
touched
Marygold
s
forehead
a
change
had
taken
place
Her
sweet
rosy
face
so
full
of
affection
as
it
had
been
assumed
a
glittering
yellow
color
with
yellow
tear
drops
congealing
on
her
cheeks
Her
beautiful
brown
ringlets
took
the
same
tint
Her
soft
and
tender
little
form
grew
hard
and
inflexible
within
her
father
s
encircling
arms
O
terrible
misfortune
The
victim
of
his
insatiable
desire
for
wealth
little
Marygold
was
a
human
child
no
longer
but
a
golden
statue
Yes
there
she
was
with
the
questioning
look
of
love
grief
and
pity
hardened
into
her
face
It
was
the
prettiest
and
most
woful
sight
that
ever
mortal
saw
All
the
features
and
tokens
of
Marygold
were
there
even
the
beloved
little
dimple
remained
in
her
golden
chin
But
the
more
perfect
was
the
resemblance
the
greater
was
the
father
s
agony
at
beholding
this
golden
image
which
was
all
that
was
left
him
of
a
daughter
It
had
been
a
favorite
phrase
of
Midas
whenever
he
felt
particularly
fond
of
the
child
to
say
that
she
was
worth
her
weight
in
gold
And
now
the
phrase
had
become
literally
true
And
now
at
last
when
it
was
too
late
he
felt
how
infinitely
a
warm
and
tender
heart
that
loved
him
exceeded
in
value
all
the
wealth
that
could
be
piled
up
betwixt
the
earth
and
sky
It
would
be
too
sad
a
story
if
I
were
to
tell
you
how
Midas
in
the
fulness
of
all
his
gratified
desires
began
to
wring
his
hands
and
bemoan
himself
and
how
he
could
neither
bear
to
look
at
Marygold
nor
yet
to
look
away
from
her
Except
when
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
image
he
could
not
possibly
believe
that
she
was
changed
to
gold
But
stealing
another
glance
there
was
the
precious
little
figure
with
a
yellow
tear
drop
on
its
yellow
cheek
and
a
look
so
piteous
and
tender
that
it
seemed
as
if
that
very
expression
must
needs
soften
the
gold
and
make
it
flesh
again
This
however
could
not
be
So
Midas
had
only
to
wring
his
hands
and
to
wish
that
he
were
the
poorest
man
in
the
wide
world
if
the
loss
of
all
his
wealth
might
bring
back
the
faintest
rose
color
to
his
dear
child
s
face
While
he
was
in
this
tumult
of
despair
he
suddenly
beheld
a
stranger
standing
near
the
door
Midas
bent
down
his
head
without
speaking
for
he
recognized
the
same
figure
which
had
appeared
to
him
the
day
before
in
the
treasure
room
and
had
bestowed
on
him
this
disastrous
power
of
the
Golden
Touch
The
stranger
s
countenance
still
wore
a
smile
which
seemed
to
shed
a
yellow
lustre
all
about
the
room
and
gleamed
on
little
Marygold
s
image
and
on
the
other
objects
that
had
been
transmuted
by
the
touch
of
Midas
Well
friend
Midas
said
the
stranger
pray
how
do
you
succeed
with
the
Golden
Touch
Midas
shook
his
head
I
am
very
miserable
said
he
Very
miserable
indeed
exclaimed
the
stranger
and
how
happens
that
Have
I
not
faithfully
kept
my
promise
with
you
Have
you
not
every
thing
that
your
heart
desired
Gold
is
not
every
thing
answered
Midas
And
I
have
lost
all
that
my
heart
really
cared
for
Ah
So
you
have
made
a
discovery
since
yesterday
observed
the
stranger
Let
us
see
then
Which
of
these
two
things
do
you
think
is
really
worth
the
most
the
gift
of
the
Golden
Touch
or
one
cup
of
clear
cold
water
O
blessed
water
exclaimed
Midas
It
will
never
moisten
my
parched
throat
again
The
Golden
Touch
continued
the
stranger
or
a
crust
of
bread
A
piece
of
bread
answered
Midas
is
worth
all
the
gold
on
earth
The
Golden
Touch
asked
the
stranger
or
your
own
little
Marygold
warm
soft
and
loving
as
she
was
an
hour
ago
O
my
child
my
dear
child
cried
poor
King
Midas
wringing
his
hands
I
would
not
have
given
that
one
small
dimple
in
her
chin
for
the
power
of
changing
this
whole
big
earth
into
a
solid
lump
of
gold
You
are
wiser
than
you
were
King
Midas
said
the
stranger
looking
seriously
at
him
Your
own
heart
I
perceive
has
not
been
entirely
changed
from
flesh
to
gold
Were
it
so
your
case
would
indeed
be
desperate
But
you
appear
to
be
still
capable
of
understanding
that
the
commonest
things
such
as
lie
within
everybody
s
grasp
are
more
valuable
than
the
riches
which
so
many
mortals
sigh
and
struggle
after
Tell
me
now
do
you
sincerely
desire
to
rid
yourself
of
this
Golden
Touch
It
is
hateful
to
me
replied
Midas
A
fly
settled
on
his
nose
but
immediately
fell
to
the
floor
for
it
too
had
become
gold
Midas
shuddered
Go
then
said
the
stranger
and
plunge
into
the
river
that
glides
past
the
bottom
of
your
garden
Take
likewise
a
vase
of
the
same
water
and
sprinkle
it
over
any
object
that
you
may
desire
to
change
back
again
from
gold
into
its
former
substance
If
you
do
this
in
earnestness
and
sincerity
it
may
possibly
repair
the
mischief
which
your
avarice
has
occasioned
King
Midas
bowed
low
and
when
he
lifted
his
head
the
lustrous
stranger
had
vanished
You
will
easily
believe
that
Midas
lost
no
time
in
snatching
up
a
great
earthen
pitcher
but
alas
me
it
was
no
longer
earthen
after
he
touched
it
and
in
hastening
to
the
river
side
As
he
ran
along
and
forced
his
way
through
the
shrubbery
it
was
positively
marvellous
to
see
how
the
foliage
turned
yellow
behind
him
as
if
the
autumn
had
been
there
and
nowhere
else
On
reaching
the
river
s
brink
he
plunged
headlong
in
without
waiting
so
much
as
to
pull
off
his
shoes
Poof
poof
poof
gasped
King
Midas
as
his
head
emerged
out
of
the
water
Well
this
is
really
a
refreshing
bath
and
I
think
it
must
have
quite
washed
away
the
Golden
Touch
And
now
for
filling
my
pitcher
As
he
dipped
the
pitcher
into
the
water
it
gladdened
his
very
heart
to
see
it
change
from
gold
into
the
same
good
honest
earthen
vessel
which
it
had
been
before
he
touched
it
He
was
conscious
also
of
a
change
within
himself
A
cold
hard
and
heavy
weight
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
his
bosom
No
doubt
his
heart
had
been
gradually
losing
its
human
substance
and
been
changing
into
insensible
metal
but
had
now
been
softened
back
again
into
flesh
Perceiving
a
violet
that
grew
on
the
bank
of
the
river
Midas
touched
it
with
his
finger
and
was
overjoyed
to
find
that
the
delicate
flower
retained
its
purple
hue
instead
of
undergoing
a
yellow
blight
The
curse
of
the
Golden
Touch
had
therefore
really
been
removed
from
him
King
Midas
hastened
back
to
the
palace
and
I
suppose
the
servants
knew
not
what
to
make
of
it
when
they
saw
their
royal
master
so
carefully
bringing
home
an
earthen
pitcher
of
water
But
that
water
which
was
to
undo
all
the
mischief
that
his
folly
had
wrought
was
more
precious
to
Midas
than
an
ocean
of
molten
gold
could
have
been
The
first
thing
he
did
as
you
need
hardly
be
told
was
to
sprinkle
it
by
handfuls
over
the
golden
figure
of
little
Marygold
No
sooner
did
it
fall
on
her
than
you
would
have
laughed
to
see
how
the
rosy
color
came
back
to
the
dear
child
s
cheek
and
how
astonished
she
was
to
find
herself
dripping
wet
and
her
father
still
throwing
more
water
over
her
Pray
do
not
dear
father
cried
she
See
how
you
have
wet
my
nice
frock
which
I
put
on
only
this
morning
Illustration
For
Marygold
did
not
know
that
she
had
been
a
little
golden
statue
nor
could
she
remember
any
thing
that
had
happened
since
the
moment
when
she
ran
with
outstretched
arms
to
comfort
poor
King
Midas
Her
father
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
tell
his
beloved
child
how
very
foolish
he
had
been
but
contented
himself
with
showing
how
much
wiser
he
had
now
grown
For
this
purpose
he
led
little
Marygold
into
the
garden
where
he
sprinkled
all
the
remainder
of
the
water
over
the
rose
bushes
and
with
such
good
effect
that
above
five
thousand
roses
recovered
their
beautiful
bloom
There
were
two
circumstances
however
which
as
long
as
he
lived
used
to
remind
King
Midas
of
the
Golden
Touch
One
was
that
the
sands
of
the
river
in
which
he
had
bathed
sparkled
like
gold
the
other
that
little
Marygold
s
hair
had
now
a
golden
tinge
which
he
had
never
observed
in
it
before
she
had
been
changed
by
the
effect
of
his
kiss
This
change
of
hue
was
really
an
improvement
and
made
Marygold
s
hair
richer
than
in
her
babyhood
When
King
Midas
had
grown
quite
an
old
man
and
used
to
take
Marygold
s
children
on
his
knee
he
was
fond
of
telling
them
this
marvellous
story
pretty
much
as
I
have
told
it
to
you
And
then
would
he
stroke
their
glossy
ringlets
and
tell
them
that
their
hair
likewise
had
a
rich
shade
of
gold
which
they
had
inherited
from
their
mother
And
to
tell
you
the
truth
my
precious
little
folks
said
King
Midas
ever
since
that
morning
I
have
hated
the
very
sight
of
all
other
gold
save
this
Life
we
ve
been
long
together
Through
pleasant
and
through
cloudy
weather
Tis
hard
to
part
when
friends
are
dear
Perhaps
twill
cost
a
sigh
a
tear
Then
steal
away
give
little
warning
Choose
thine
own
time
Say
not
Good
Night
but
in
some
brighter
clime
Bid
me
Good
Morning

John
Gilpin
kissed
his
loving
wife
O
erjoyed
was
he
to
find
That
though
on
pleasure
she
was
bent
She
had
a
frugal
mind
The
morning
came
the
chaise
was
brought
But
yet
was
not
allowed
To
drive
up
to
the
door
lest
all
Should
say
that
she
was
proud
So
three
doors
off
the
chaise
was
stayed
Where
they
did
all
get
in
Six
precious
souls
and
all
agog
To
dash
through
thick
and
thin
Smack
went
the
whip
round
went
the
wheels
Were
never
folks
so
glad
The
stones
did
rattle
underneath
As
if
Cheapside
were
mad
John
Gilpin
at
his
horse
s
side
Seized
fast
the
flowing
mane
And
up
he
got
in
haste
to
ride
But
soon
came
down
again
For
saddle
tree
scarce
reached
had
he
His
journey
to
begin
When
turning
round
his
head
he
saw
Three
customers
come
in
So
down
he
came
for
loss
of
time
Although
it
grieved
him
sore
Yet
loss
of
pence
full
well
he
knew
Would
trouble
him
much
more
Twas
long
before
the
customers
Were
suited
to
their
mind
When
Betty
screaming
came
down
stairs
The
wine
is
left
behind
Good
lack
quoth
he
yet
bring
it
me
My
leathern
belt
likewise
In
which
I
bear
my
trusty
sword
When
I
do
exercise
Now
Mrs
Gilpin
careful
soul
Had
two
stone
bottles
found
To
hold
the
liquor
that
she
loved
And
keep
it
safe
and
sound
Each
bottle
had
a
curling
ear
Through
which
the
belt
he
drew
And
hung
a
bottle
on
each
side
To
make
his
balance
true
Then
over
all
that
he
might
be
Equipped
from
top
to
toe
His
long
red
cloak
well
brushed
and
neat
He
manfully
did
throw
Now
see
him
mounted
once
again
Upon
his
nimble
steed
Full
slowly
pacing
o
er
the
stones
With
caution
and
good
heed
But
finding
soon
a
smoother
road
Beneath
his
well
shod
feet
The
snorting
beast
began
to
trot
Which
galled
him
in
his
seat
So
Fair
and
softly
John
he
cried
But
John
he
cried
in
vain
That
trot
became
a
gallop
soon
In
spite
of
curb
and
rein
So
stooping
down
as
needs
he
must
Who
cannot
sit
upright
He
grasped
the
mane
with
both
his
hands
And
eke
with
all
his
might
His
horse
who
never
in
that
sort
Had
handled
been
before
What
thing
upon
his
back
had
got
Did
wonder
more
and
more
Away
went
Gilpin
neck
or
nought
Away
went
hat
and
wig
He
little
dreamt
when
he
set
out
Of
running
such
a
rig
The
wind
did
blow
the
cloak
did
fly
Like
streamer
long
and
gay
Till
loop
and
button
failing
both
At
last
it
flew
away
Then
might
all
people
well
discern
The
bottles
he
had
slung
A
bottle
swinging
at
each
side
As
hath
been
said
or
sung
The
dogs
did
bark
the
children
screamed
Up
flew
the
windows
all
And
every
soul
cried
out
Well
done
As
loud
as
he
could
bawl
Away
went
Gilpin
who
but
he
His
fame
soon
spread
around
He
carries
weight
he
rides
a
race
Tis
for
a
thousand
pound
And
still
as
fast
as
he
drew
near
Twas
wonderful
to
view
How
in
a
trice
the
turnpike
men
Their
gates
wide
open
threw
And
now
as
he
went
bowing
down
His
reeking
head
full
low
The
bottles
twain
behind
his
back
Were
shattered
at
a
blow
Down
ran
the
wine
into
the
road
Most
piteous
to
be
seen
Which
made
his
horse
s
flanks
to
smoke
As
they
had
basted
been
But
still
he
seemed
to
carry
weight
With
leathern
girdle
braced
For
all
might
see
the
bottle
necks
Still
dangling
at
his
waist
Thus
all
through
merry
Islington
These
gambols
did
he
play
Until
he
came
unto
the
Wash
Of
Edmonton
so
gay
And
there
he
threw
the
Wash
about
On
both
sides
of
the
way
Just
like
unto
a
trundling
mop
Or
a
wild
goose
at
play
At
Edmonton
his
loving
wife
From
the
balcony
espied
Her
tender
husband
wondering
much
To
see
how
he
did
ride
Stop
stop
John
Gilpin
Here
s
the
house
They
all
at
once
did
cry
The
dinner
waits
and
we
are
tired
Said
Gilpin
So
am
I
But
yet
his
horse
was
not
a
whit
Inclined
to
tarry
there
For
why
his
owner
had
a
house
Full
ten
miles
off
at
Ware
So
like
an
arrow
swift
he
flew
Shot
by
an
archer
strong
So
did
he
fly
which
brings
me
to
The
middle
of
my
song
Away
went
Gilpin
out
of
breath
And
sore
against
his
will
Till
at
his
friend
the
calender
s
His
horse
at
last
stood
still
The
calender
amazed
to
see
His
neighbor
in
such
trim
Laid
down
his
pipe
flew
to
the
gate
And
thus
accosted
him
What
news
what
news
your
tidings
tell
Tell
me
you
must
and
shall
Say
why
bareheaded
you
are
come
Or
why
you
come
at
all
Now
Gilpin
had
a
pleasant
wit
And
loved
a
timely
joke
And
thus
unto
the
calender
In
merry
guise
he
spoke
I
came
because
your
horse
would
come
And
if
I
well
forebode
My
hat
and
wig
will
soon
be
here
They
are
upon
the
road
The
calender
right
glad
to
find
His
friend
in
merry
pin
Returned
him
not
a
single
word
But
to
the
house
went
in
Whence
straight
he
came
with
hat
and
wig
A
wig
that
flowed
behind
A
hat
not
much
the
worse
for
wear
Each
comely
in
its
kind
He
held
them
up
and
in
his
turn
Thus
showed
his
ready
wit
My
head
is
twice
as
big
as
yours
They
therefore
needs
must
fit
But
let
me
scrape
the
dirt
away
That
hangs
upon
your
face
And
stop
and
eat
for
well
you
may
Be
in
a
hungry
case
Said
John
It
is
my
wedding
day
And
all
the
world
would
stare
If
wife
should
dine
at
Edmonton
And
I
should
dine
at
Ware
So
turning
to
his
horse
he
said
I
am
in
haste
to
dine
Twas
for
your
pleasure
you
came
here
You
shall
go
back
for
mine
Ah
luckless
speech
and
bootless
boast
For
which
he
paid
full
dear
For
while
he
spake
a
braying
ass
Did
sing
most
loud
and
clear
Whereat
his
horse
did
snort
as
he
Had
heard
a
lion
roar
And
galloped
off
with
all
his
might
As
he
had
done
before
Away
went
Gilpin
and
away
Went
Gilpin
s
hat
and
wig
He
lost
them
sooner
than
at
first
For
why
they
were
too
big
Now
mistress
Gilpin
when
she
saw
Her
husband
posting
down
Into
the
country
far
away
She
pulled
out
half
a
crown
And
thus
unto
the
youth
she
said
That
drove
them
to
the
Bell
This
shall
be
yours
when
you
bring
back
My
husband
safe
and
well
The
youth
did
ride
and
soon
did
meet
John
coming
back
amain
Whom
in
a
trice
he
tried
to
stop
By
catching
at
his
rein
But
not
performing
what
he
meant
And
gladly
would
have
done
The
frighted
steed
he
frighted
more
And
made
him
faster
run
Away
went
Gilpin
and
away
Went
postboy
at
his
heels
The
postboy
s
horse
right
glad
to
miss
The
lumbering
of
the
wheels
Six
gentlemen
upon
the
road
Thus
seeing
Gilpin
fly
With
postboy
scampering
in
the
rear
They
raised
the
hue
and
cry
Stop
thief
stop
thief
a
highwayman
Not
one
of
them
was
mute
And
all
and
each
that
passed
that
way
Did
join
in
the
pursuit
And
now
the
turnpike
gates
again
Flew
open
in
short
space
The
toll
men
thinking
as
before
That
Gilpin
rode
a
race
And
so
he
did
and
won
it
too
For
he
got
first
to
town
Nor
stopped
till
where
he
had
got
up
He
did
again
get
down
Now
let
us
sing
long
live
the
king
And
Gilpin
long
live
he
And
when
he
next
doth
ride
abroad
May
I
be
there
to
see

PREFACE
The
plan
of
the
Third
Reader
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
Second
with
the
exception
that
a
few
historical
lessons
have
been
introduced
and
two
lessons
which
may
serve
as
an
introduction
to
Physical
Science
The
botanical
lessons
supplement
those
given
in
the
Second
Reader
These
and
the
lessons
on
Canadian
trees
and
all
lessons
relating
to
things
in
nature
should
be
made
the
subjects
of
conversation
between
the
teacher
and
his
class
and
should
form
a
basis
for
scientific
instruction
The
pupils
should
be
led
to
study
nature
directly
To
this
end
they
should
be
required
to
obtain
wherever
possible
the
natural
objects
which
are
described
in
the
lessons
and
to
examine
them
and
to
form
opinions
for
themselves
concerning
them
Similarly
every
lesson
should
form
the
subject
of
conversation
before
reading
during
the
progress
of
the
reading
and
after
reading
the
teacher
eliciting
from
his
pupils
clear
statements
of
their
knowledge
of
it
correcting
any
wrong
notions
they
may
have
of
it
throwing
them
back
upon
their
own
experience
or
reading
and
leading
them
to
observe
compare
and
judge
and
to
state
in
words
the
results
of
their
observations
comparisons
and
judgments
Some
of
these
statements
should
be
written
on
the
blackboard
and
then
be
made
the
subject
of
critical
conversation
others
might
be
written
by
the
pupils
at
their
desks
and
afterwards
be
reviewed
in
class
In
this
incidental
teaching
it
should
be
the
teacher
s
aim
to
develop
the
previous
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
pupils
concerning
a
lesson
into
a
full
and
complete
knowledge
This
can
best
be
effected
by
judicious
questioning
and
conversation
The
illustrations
of
the
lessons
as
in
the
Second
Reader
are
intended
to
aid
the
pupils
in
obtaining
real
conceptions
of
the
ideas
involved
in
the
lessons
Children
vary
greatly
in
capacity
for
imagination
It
is
essential
however
to
the
proper
understanding
of
a
lesson
and
hence
to
the
proper
reading
of
it
that
a
child
be
able
to
imagine
the
persons
actions
objects
described
in
it
The
illustrations
will
aid
in
developing
this
power
of
imagination
and
the
teacher
by
his
questions
and
appropriate
criticisms
and
by
a
judicious
use
of
his
own
greater
knowledge
and
experience
will
aid
still
more
in
developing
it
In
the
poetry
great
care
has
been
taken
to
select
not
only
such
pieces
as
children
can
easily
comprehend
but
also
such
as
are
in
themselves
good
literature
Many
old
favorites
have
been
retained
their
worth
as
reading
lessons
having
been
proved
with
generations
of
school
children
In
the
reading
of
poetry
the
teacher
must
constantly
assure
himself
that
the
pupils
clearly
understand
what
they
read
Children
have
a
natural
ear
for
rhythm
and
a
fondness
for
rhyme
Hence
they
easily
learn
to
read
verse
being
insensibly
charmed
by
its
melody
But
they
cannot
with
equal
facility
comprehend
the
poetical
meanings
the
terse
expressions
and
the
inverted
constructions
with
which
verse
abounds
Much
more
time
therefore
should
be
spent
by
the
teacher
in
poetry
than
in
prose
in
eliciting
from
his
pupils
the
meanings
of
words
phrases
and
sentences
He
should
not
rest
satisfied
until
the
pupils
can
substitute
for
every
more
important
word
phrase
and
sentence
of
a
poem
an
equivalent
of
their
own
finding
He
must
be
certain
too
that
they
understand
the
substitutions
which
they
offer
Conversation
and
questioning
will
here
as
elsewhere
in
school
work
help
him
in
effecting
his
purpose
The
exercises
which
are
put
at
the
end
of
some
of
the
lessons
are
intended
merely
as
examples
of
exercises
which
the
teacher
can
himself
prepare
for
all
the
lessons
Methods
of
using
these
have
been
described
in
the
Preface
to
the
Second
Reader
In
the
Word
Exercises
many
of
the
words
have
been
re
spelled
phonetically
to
indicate
their
pronunciation
This
too
is
merely
an
example
of
what
may
be
done
with
all
words
Pupils
should
be
taught
to
pick
out
the
silent
letters
in
words
and
to
indicate
the
true
phonetic
equivalents
of
the
orthographical
expedients
as
they
are
called
by
which
vowel
sounds
are
often
indicated
For
example
in
neighbour
g
h
and
either
o
or
u
are
silent
and
ei
does
duty
for
so
that
the
pronunciation
of
the
word
may
be
indicated
by
n
bor
or
n
bur
It
will
be
a
useful
exercise
for
the
pupils
sometimes
to
write
out
in
this
way
on
the
blackboard
the
phonetic
spelling
of
the
irregularly
spelled
words
which
occur
in
their
lessons
alongside
of
their
common
spelling
Practice
will
soon
give
facility
in
doing
this
It
is
believed
that
by
such
practice
the
orthography
of
irregularly
spelled
words
will
be
more
easily
remembered
and
accuracy
of
pronunciation
more
readily
gained
To
aid
in
securing
accuracy
of
pronunciation
a
short
chapter
on
Ortho
py
has
been
prefixed
to
the
reading
lessons
The
statements
in
it
are
to
form
a
basis
for
lessons
to
be
given
by
the
teacher
to
the
pupils
in
conversation
Ortho
py
is
acquired
only
by
constant
attention
to
utterance
Carefulness
in
enunciation
must
first
become
a
habit
The
correct
pronunciation
of
individual
words
will
then
be
gained
by
the
imitation
of
those
who
speak
correctly
or
reference
to
a
dictionary
It
is
true
that
in
the
pronunciation
of
many
words
authorities
differ
widely
hence
dogmatism
in
pronunciation
is
to
be
avoided
Notwithstanding
this
no
one
can
hope
to
become
a
correct
speaker
without
the
careful
study
of
a
dictionary
The
teacher
should
see
that
the
system
of
sound
marking
adopted
by
the
dictionary
in
use
in
his
school
is
understood
by
his
pupils
so
that
they
may
consult
it
intelligently

ORTHO
PY
Ortho
py
or
Correct
Pronunciation
is
the
utterance
of
words
with
their
right
sounds
and
accents
as
sanctioned
by
the
best
usage
It
depends
principally
upon
Articulation
Syllabication
and
Accentuation
Articulation
is
the
distinct
utterance
of
the
elementary
vowel
and
consonant
sounds
of
the
language
whether
separate
or
combined
into
syllables
and
words
In
pronouncing
a
word
its
elementary
sounds
should
be
correctly
articulated
The
more
common
faults
in
articulation
are
Omitting
a
vowel
sound
or
substituting
one
vowel
sound
for
another
in
an
unaccented
syllable
Of
all
faults
in
pronunciation
probably
this
is
the
commonest
As
a
rule
it
results
from
carelessness
in
utterance
Examples
of
it
are

Substituting
one
vowel
sound
for
another
in
an
accented
syllable
or
a
one

word
This
fault
may
result
not
from
carelessness
but
from
want
of
knowledge
for
the
correct
pronunciation
of
the
vowel
sounds
of
words
must
be

from

Syllabication
in
Ortho
py
is
the
correct
formation
of
syllables
in
pronouncing
words
A
syllable
is
a
sound
or
a
combination
of
sounds
uttered
by
a
single
impulse
of
the
voice
and
constituting
a
word
or
a
part
of
a
word
A
word
has
as
many
syllables
as
it
has
separate
vowel
sounds
When
words
are
uttered
so
that
their
vowel
sounds
are
clearly
and
correctly
articulated
they
will
be
properly
syllabified
Accentuation
is
the
correct
placing
of
accent
in
uttering
words
Accent
is
a
superior
stress
or
force
of
voice
upon
certain
syllables
of
words
which
distinguishes
them
from
the
other
syllables
In
uttering
a
word
of
more
than
one
syllable
one
of
the
syllables
receives
a
greater
stress
in
pronunciation
than
the
others
and
is
said
to
be
accented
or
to
have
the
accent
Some
words
have
more
than
one
syllable
accented
as
con
fla
gra
tion
in
com
pre
hen
si
bil
ity
but
one
syllable
is
always
more
strongly
accented
than
the
others
and
is
said
to
have
the
main
or
primary
accent
Accentuation
like
the
other
elements
of
ortho
py
is
fixed
by
usage
that
is
by
the
practice
of
those
who
are
recognized
as
correct
speakers
In
the
pronunciation
of
a
word
care
should
be
taken
to
give
to
the
vowels
their
proper
sounds
to
place
the
accent
upon
the
right
syllable
and
to
sound
the
consonants
distinctly
The
tendency
to
drop
consonant
sounds
and
to
pronounce
indistinctly
or
incorrectly
the
vowel
sounds
of
unaccented
syllables
should
be
carefully
guarded
against
The
distinction
between
syllables
should
be
carefully
made
and
especially
the
distinction
between
separate
words
Carelessness
in
this
respect
may
make
the
meanings
of
sentences
uncertain
For
example
He
saw
two
beggars
steal
may
sound
as
He
sought
to
beg
or
steal
He
had
two
small
eggs
may
sound
as
He
had
two
small
legs
and
Can
there
be
an
aim
more
lofty
as
Can
there
be
a
name
more
lofty
This
blending
of
the
sounds
of
words
is
prevented
partly
by
distinctly
uttering
the
sounds
of
their
initial
letters
but
chiefly
by
distinctly
uttering
and
slightly
dwelling
upon
the
sounds
of
their
final
letters
THIRD
READER
I
THE
WHITE
SHIP
CHARLES
DICKENS
King
Henry
I
went
over
to
Normandy
with
his
son
Prince
William
and
a
great
retinue
to
have
the
prince
acknowledged
as
his
successor
and
to
contract
a
marriage
between
him
and
the
daughter
of
the
Count
of
Anjou
Both
these
things
were
triumphantly
done
with
great
show
and
rejoicing
and
on
the
th
of
November
in
the
year
the
whole
retinue
prepared
to
embark
for
the
voyage
home
On
that
day
there
came
to
the
king
Fitz
Stephen
a
sea
captain
and
said
My
liege
my
father
served
your
father
all
his
life
upon
the
sea
He
steered
the
ship
with
the
golden
boy
upon
the
prow
in
which
your
father
sailed
to
conquer
England
I
have
a
fair
vessel
in
the
harbor
here
called
The
White
Ship
manned
by
fifty
sailors
of
renown
I
pray
you
Sire
to
let
your
servant
have
the
honor
of
steering
you
in
The
White
Ship
to
England
I
am
sorry
friend
replied
the
king
that
my
ship
is
already
chosen
and
that
I
cannot
therefore
sail
with
the
son
of
the
man
who
served
my
father
But
the
prince
and
his
company
shall
go
along
with
you
in
the
fair
White
Ship
manned
by
the
fifty
sailors
of
renown
An
hour
or
two
afterward
the
king
set
sail
in
the
vessel
he
had
chosen
accompanied
by
other
vessels
and
sailing
all
night
with
a
fair
and
gentle
wind
arrived
upon
the
coast
of
England
in
the
morning
While
it
was
yet
night
the
people
in
some
of
these
ships
heard
a
faint
wild
cry
come
over
the
sea
and
wondered
what
it
was
Illustration
Now
the
prince
was
a
dissolute
young
man
of
eighteen
who
bore
no
love
to
the
English
and
who
had
declared
that
when
he
came
to
the
throne
he
would
yoke
them
to
the
plough
like
oxen
He
went
aboard
The
White
Ship
with
one
hundred
and
forty
youthful
nobles
like
himself
among
whom
were
eighteen
noble
ladies
of
the
highest
rank
All
this
gay
company
with
their
servants
and
the
fifty
sailors
made
three
hundred
souls
aboard
the
fair
White
Ship
Give
three
casks
of
wine
Fitz
Stephen
said
the
prince
to
the
fifty
sailors
of
renown
My
father
the
king
has
sailed
out
of
the
harbor
What
time
is
there
to
make
merry
here
and
yet
reach
England
with
the
rest
Prince
said
Fitz
Stephen
before
morning
my
fifty
and
The
White
Ship
shall
overtake
the
swiftest
vessel
in
attendance
on
your
father
the
king
if
we
sail
at
midnight
Then
the
prince
commanded
to
make
merry
and
the
sailors
drank
out
the
three
casks
of
wine
and
the
prince
and
all
the
noble
company
danced
in
the
moonlight
on
the
deck
of
The
White
Ship
When
at
last
she
shot
out
of
the
harbor
there
was
not
a
sober
seaman
on
board
But
the
sails
were
all
set
and
the
oars
all
going
merrily
Fitz
Stephen
had
the
helm
The
gay
young
nobles
and
the
beautiful
ladies
wrapped
in
mantles
of
various
bright
colors
to
protect
them
from
the
cold
talked
laughed
and
sang
The
prince
encouraged
the
fifty
sailors
to
row
yet
harder
for
the
honor
of
The
White
Ship
Crash
A
terrific
cry
broke
from
three
hundred
hearts
It
was
the
cry
the
people
in
the
distant
vessels
of
the
king
heard
faintly
on
the
water
The
White
Ship
had
struck
upon
a
rock
was
filling
going
down
Fitz
Stephen
hurried
the
prince
into
a
boat
with
some
few
nobles
Push
off
he
whispered
and
row
to
the
land
It
is
not
far
and
the
sea
is
smooth
The
rest
of
us
must
die
But
as
they
rowed
fast
away
from
the
sinking
ship
the
prince
heard
the
voice
of
his
sister
calling
for
help
He
never
in
his
life
had
been
so
good
as
he
was
then
He
cried
in
agony
Row
back
at
any
risk
I
cannot
bear
to
leave
her
They
rowed
back
As
the
prince
held
out
his
arm
to
catch
his
sister
such
numbers
leaped
into
the
boat
that
it
was
overset
And
in
the
same
instant
The
White
Ship
went
down
Only
two
men
floated
They
both
clung
to
the
mainyard
of
the
ship
which
had
broken
from
the
mast
and
now
supported
them
One
asked
the
other
who
he
was
He
replied
I
am
a
nobleman
Godfrey
by
name
son
of
Gilbert
And
you
I
am
a
poor
butcher
of
Rouen
was
the
answer
Then
they
said
together
Lord
be
merciful
to
us
both
and
tried
to
encourage
each
other
as
they
drifted
in
the
cold
benumbing
sea
on
that
unfortunate
November
night
By
and
by
another
man
came
swimming
toward
them
whom
they
knew
when
he
pushed
aside
his
long
wet
hair
to
be
Fitz
Stephen
Where
is
the
prince
said
he
Gone
gone
the
two
cried
together
Neither
he
nor
his
brother
nor
his
sister
nor
the
king
s
niece
nor
her
brother
nor
any
one
of
all
the
brave
three
hundred
noble
or
commoner
except
us
three
has
risen
above
the
water
Fitz
Stephen
with
a
ghastly
face
cried
Woe
woe
to
me
and
sank
to
the
bottom
The
other
two
clung
to
the
yard
for
some
hours
At
length
the
young
noble
said
faintly
I
am
exhausted
and
chilled
with
the
cold
and
can
hold
no
longer
Farewell
good
friend
God
preserve
you
So
he
dropped
and
sank
and
of
all
the
brilliant
crowd
the
poor
butcher
of
Rouen
alone
was
saved
In
the
morning
some
fishermen
saw
him
floating
in
his
sheep
skin
coat
and
got
him
into
their
boat
the
sole
relator
of
the
dismal
tale
For
three
days
no
one
dared
to
carry
the
intelligence
to
the
king
At
length
they
sent
into
his
presence
a
little
boy
who
weeping
bitterly
and
falling
at
his
feet
told
him
that
The
White
Ship
was
lost
with
all
on
board
The
king
fell
to
the
ground
like
a
dead
man
and
never
never
afterward
was
seen
to
smile

THE
GIRAFFE
OR
CAMELOPARD
There
are
few
sights
more
pleasing
than
a
herd
of
tall
graceful
giraffes
With
their
heads
reaching
a
height
of
from
twelve
to
eighteen
feet
they
move
about
in
small
herds
on
the
open
plains
of
Africa
eating
the
tender
twigs
and
leaves
of
the
mimosa
and
other
trees
Illustration
The
legs
of
a
large
giraffe
are
about
nine
feet
long
and
its
neck
nearly
six
feet
while
its
body
measures
only
seven
feet
in
length
and
slopes
rapidly
from
the
neck
to
the
tail
The
graceful
appearance
of
the
giraffe
is
increased
by
the
beauty
of
its
skin
which
is
orange
red
in
color
and
mottled
with
dark
spots
Its
long
tail
has
at
the
end
a
tuft
of
thick
hair
which
serves
the
purpose
of
keeping
off
the
flies
and
stinging
insects
so
plentiful
in
the
hot
climate
of
Africa
Its
tongue
is
very
wonderful
It
is
from
thirteen
to
seventeen
inches
in
length
is
slender
and
pointed
and
is
capable
of
being
moved
in
so
many
ways
that
it
is
almost
as
useful
to
the
giraffe
as
the
trunk
is
to
the
elephant
The
horns
of
the
giraffe
are
very
short
and
covered
with
skin
At
the
ends
there
are
tufts
of
short
hair
The
animal
has
divided
hoofs
somewhat
resembling
those
of
the
ox
The
head
of
the
giraffe
is
small
and
its
eyes
large
and
mild
looking
These
eyes
are
set
in
such
a
way
that
the
animal
can
see
a
great
deal
of
what
is
behind
it
without
turning
its
head
In
addition
to
its
wonderful
power
of
sight
the
giraffe
can
scent
danger
from
a
great
distance
so
that
there
is
no
animal
more
difficult
of
approach
Strange
to
relate
the
giraffe
has
no
voice
In
London
some
years
ago
two
giraffes
were
burned
to
death
in
their
stables
when
the
slightest
sound
would
have
given
notice
of
their
danger
and
have
saved
their
lives
The
giraffe
is
naturally
both
gentle
and
timid
and
he
will
always
try
to
avoid
danger
by
flight
It
is
when
running
that
he
exposes
his
only
ungraceful
point
He
runs
swiftly
but
since
he
moves
his
fore
and
hind
legs
on
each
side
at
the
same
time
the
movement
gives
him
a
very
awkward
gait
But
though
timid
he
will
when
overtaken
turn
even
upon
the
lion
or
panther
and
defend
himself
successfully
by
powerful
kicks
with
his
strong
legs
The
natives
of
Africa
capture
the
giraffe
in
pitfalls
which
are
deep
holes
covered
over
with
branches
of
trees
and
dirt
When
captured
the
giraffe
can
be
tamed
and
during
its
captivity
it
gives
scarcely
any
trouble
Fifty
years
ago
but
little
was
known
about
the
giraffe
in
America
or
Europe
Now
it
is
to
be
found
in
menageries
and
the
public
gardens
of
large
cities
The
giraffe
thrives
in
captivity
and
seems
to
be
well
satisfied
with
a
diet
of
corn
and
hay
It
is
a
source
of
great
satisfaction
to
those
who
admire
this
beautiful
animal
that
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
it
from
living
in
a
climate
so
different
from
that
of
its
African
home

THE
PET
LAMB
WORDSWORTH
Illustration
The
dew
was
falling
fast
the
stars
began
to
blink
I
heard
a
voice
it
said
Drink
pretty
creature
drink
And
looking
o
er
the
hedge
before
me
I
espied
A
snow
white
mountain
lamb
with
a
maiden
at
its
side
No
other
sheep
were
near
the
lamb
was
all
alone
And
by
a
slender
cord
was
tethered
to
a
stone
With
one
knee
on
the
grass
did
the
little
maiden
kneel
While
to
that
mountain
lamb
she
gave
its
evening
meal
The
lamb
while
from
her
hand
he
thus
his
supper
took
Seemed
to
feast
with
head
and
ears
and
his
tail
with
pleasure
shook
Drink
pretty

drink
she
said
in
such
a
tone
That
I
almost
received
her
heart
into
my
own
Twas
little
Barbara
Lewthwaite
a
child
of
beauty
rare
I
watched
them
with
delight
they
were
a
lovely
pair
Now
with
her
empty
can
the
maiden
turned
away
But
ere
ten
yards
were
gone
her
footsteps
did
she
stay
Towards
the
lamb
she
looked
and
from
that
shady
place
I
unobserved
could
see
the
workings
of
her
face
If
Nature
to
her
tongue
could
measured
numbers
bring
Thus
thought
I
to
her
lamb
that
little
maid
might
sing
What
ails
thee
young
one
What
Why
pull
so
at
thy
cord
Is

Well

I

As

I

THE
CAMEL
In
Asia
and
in
Africa
there
are
vast
plains
of
sand
upon
which
no
grass
grows
and
through
which
no
river
runs
These
plains
are
as
smooth
as
the
ocean
unmoved
by
waves
As
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
nothing
is
to
be
seen
but
sand
In
the
middle
of
the
day
when
the
sun
is
hottest
the
sand
dazzles
the
eyes
of
the
traveller
as
if
there
were
a
sun
beneath
the
sand
as
well
as
one
above
Here
and
there
but
many
miles
apart
are
green
spots
consisting
of
bushes
trees
and
grass
growing
around
a
small
pool
or
spring
of
water
These
green
spots
are
called
oases
Here
the
tired
traveller
can
find
food
and
shade
and
can
sleep
awhile
sheltered
from
the
blazing
sun
How
do
you
think
the
traveller
crosses
these
burning
plains
Not
in
carriages
nor
on
horseback
nor
in
railroad
trains
but
on
the
backs
of
tall
long
necked
humpbacked
camels
Even
if
you
have
seen
camels
alive
or
pictures
of
them
you
will
still
be
glad
to
learn
more
about
these
very
useful
animals
The
camel
lives
on
grass
and
the
dry
short
herbage
which
is
found
on
the
edges
of
the
desert
While
travelling
in
the
desert
it
is
fed
upon
dates
and
barley
It
is
able
to
eat
a
great
deal
of
food
at
a
time
and
to
drink
enough
water
to
last
some
days
By
this
means
it
can
go
for
a
long
time
without
food
and
travel
long
distances
without
stopping
to
eat
or
drink
The
camel
has
a
curious
lump
of
fat
on
the
top
of
its
back
called
a
hump
One
kind
of
camel
has
two
humps
One
purpose
of
these
humps
is
to
supply
the
camel
with
strength
when
it
has
neither
food
nor
water
and
would
otherwise
die
from
want
The
foot
of
the
camel
is
a
wonderful
thing
It
is
broad
and
has
a
soft
pad
at
the
bottom
which
keeps
it
from
sinking
in
the
yielding
sand
when
the
camel
crosses
the
arid
deserts
Illustration
The
camel
with
two
humps
on
its
back
is
much
larger
and
stronger
than
the
camel
with
one
hump
The
one
humped
camel
is
known
as
the
Arabian
camel
or
dromedary
Asia
is
the
home
of
the
camel
but
numbers
of
them
are
used
in
Africa
and
other
parts
of
the
world
The
camel
is
trained
to
kneel
down
to
receive
its
load
and
to
let
its
master
get
on
its
back
The
camel
can
smell
water
at
a
great
distance
When
its
rider
is
nearly
dead
from
thirst
and
water
is
near
he
can
tell
it
by
the
greater
speed
at
which
the
camel
begins
to
travel
The
camel
is
often
called
the
ship
of
the
desert
As
the
desert
is
like
a
sea
and
the
green
spots
upon
it
like
islands
so
is
the
camel
like
a
ship
that
can
carry
the
traveller
from
one
point
to
another
quickly
and
safely
But
even
with
his
faithful
camel
the
traveller
does
not
care
to
cross
the
desert
alone
The
difficulties
of
keeping
in
the
right
track
and
the
fear
of
wild
Arabs
make
it
much
safer
for
a
number
of
travellers
to
cross
the
desert
together
Travellers
take
with
them
camel
drivers
and
men
who
know
the
way
to
look
after
the
beasts
when
they
stop
for
the
night
These
men
light
the
fires
cook
the
food
and
fill
the
large
skin
bottles
with
water
when
they
come
to
a
spring
The
travellers
camels
and
camel
drivers
together
form
what
is
called
a
caravan

LUCY
GRAY
WORDSWORTH
Illustration
Oft
I
had
heard
of
Lucy
Gray
And
when
I
crossed
the
wild
I
chanced
to
see
at
break
of
day
The
solitary
child
No
mate
no
comrade
Lucy
knew
She
dwelt
on
a
wide
moor
The
sweetest
thing
that
ever
grew
Beside
a
human
door
You
yet
may
spy
the
fawn
at
play
The
hare
upon
the
green
But
the
sweet
face
of
Lucy
Gray
Will
never
more
be
seen
To
night
will
be
a
stormy
night
You
to
the
town
must
go
And
take
a
lantern
child
to
light
Your
mother
through
the
snow
That
father
will
I
gladly
do
Tis
scarcely
afternoon
The
minster
clock
has
just
struck
two
And
yonder
is
the
moon
At
this
the
father
raised
his
hook
And
snapped
a
fagot
band
He
plied
his
work
and
Lucy
took
The
lantern
in
her
hand
Not
blither
is
the
mountain
roe
With
many
a
wanton
stroke
Her
feet
disperse
the
powdery
snow
That
rises
up
like
smoke
The
storm
came
on
before
its
time
She
wandered
up
and
down
And
many
a
hill
did
Lucy
climb
But
never
reached
the
town
The
wretched
parents
all
that
night
Went
shouting
far
and
wide
But
there
was
neither
sound
nor
sight
To
serve
them
for
a
guide
At
daybreak
on
a
hill
they
stood
That
overlooked
the
moor
And
thence
they
saw
the
bridge
of
wood
A
furlong
from
their
door
They
wept
and
turning
homeward
cried
In
heaven
we
all
shall
meet
When
in
the
snow
the
mother
spied
The
print
of
Lucy
s
feet
Then
downward
from
the
steep
hill
s
edge
They
tracked
the
footmarks
small
And
through
the
broken
hawthorn
hedge
And
by
the
long
stone
wall
And
then
an
open
field
they
crossed
The
marks
were
still
the
same
They
tracked
them
on
nor
ever
lost
And
to
the
bridge
they
came
They
followed
from
the
snowy
bank
Those
footmarks
one
by
one
Into
the
middle
of
the
plank
And
further
there
were
none
Yet
some
maintain
that
to

THE
EMPEROR
AND
THE
MAJOR
The
Emperor
Alexander
while
travelling
in
Western
Russia
came
one
day
to
a
small
town
of
which
he
knew
very
little
so
when
he
found
that
he
must
change
horses
he
thought
that
he
would
look
around
and
see
what
the
town
was
like
Illustration
Alone
habited
in
a
plain
military
coat
without
any
mark
of
his
high
rank
he
wandered
through
the
place
until
he
came
to
the
end
of
the
road
that
he
had
been
following
There
he
paused
not
knowing
which
way
to
turn
for
two
paths
were
before
him
one
to
the
right
and
one
to
the
left
Alexander
saw
a
man
standing
at
the
door
of
a
house
and
going
up
to
him
the
Emperor
said
My
friend
can
you
tell
me
which
of
these
two
roads
I
must
take
to
get
to
Kalouga
The
man
who
was
in
full
military
dress
was
smoking
a
pipe
with
an
air
of
dignity
almost
ridiculous
Astonished
that
so
plain
looking
a
traveller
should
dare
to
speak
to
him
with
familiarity
the
smoker
answered
shortly
To
the
right
Pardon
said
the
Emperor
Another
word
if
you
please
What
was
the
haughty
reply
Permit
me
to
ask
you
a
question
continued
the
Emperor
What
is
your
grade
in
the
army
Guess
And
the
pipe
blazed
away
furiously
Lieutenant
said
the
amused
Alexander
Up
came
proudly
from
the
smoker
s
lips
Captain
Higher
Major
At
last
was
the
lofty
response
The
Emperor
bowed
low
in
the
presence
of
such
greatness
Now
in
my
turn
said
the
major
with
the
grand
air
that
he
thought
fit
to
assume
in
addressing
a
humble
inferior
what
are
you
if
you
please
Guess
answered
Alexander
Lieutenant
Up
Captain
Higher
Major
Go
on
Colonel
Again
The
smoker
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
Your
Excellency
is
then
General
The
grand
air
was
fast
disappearing
You
are
coming
near
it
The
major
put
his
hand
to
his
cap
Then
your
Highness
is
Field
Marshal
By
this
time
the
grand
air
had
taken
flight
and
the
officer
so
pompous
a
moment
before
looked
as
if
the
steady
gaze
and
the
quiet
voice
of
the
traveller
had
reduced
him
to
the
last
stage
of
fear
Once
more
my
good
major
said
Alexander
His
Imperial
Majesty
exclaimed
the
man
in
surprise
and
terror
letting
his
pipe
drop
from
his
trembling
fingers
His
very
self
answered
the
Emperor
and
he
smiled
at
the
wonderful
change
in
the
major
s
face
and
manner
Ah
Sire
pardon
me
cried
the
officer
falling
on
his
knees
pardon
me
And
what
is
there
to
pardon
said
Alexander
with
real
simple
dignity
My
friend
you
have
done
me
no
harm
I
asked
you
which
road
I
should
take
and
you
told
me
Thanks
But
the
major
never
forgot
the
lesson
If
in
later
years
he
was
tempted
to
be
rude
or
haughty
to
his
so
called
inferiors
there
rose
at
once
in
his
mind
a
picture
of
a
well
remembered
scene
in
which
his
pride
of
power
had
brought
such
shame
upon
him
Two
soldiers
in
a
quiet
country
town
made
but
an
every
day
picture
after
all
but
what
a
difference
there
had
been
between
the
pompous
manner
of
the
petty
officer
and
the
natural
courteous

of
the

THE
POOR
LITTLE
MATCH
GIRL
HANS
CHRISTIAN
ANDERSEN
It
was
New
Year
s
Eve
and
a
cold
snowy
evening
On
this
night
a
poor
little
girl
walked
along
the
street
with
naked
feet
benumbed
with
cold
and
carrying
in
her
hand
a
bundle
of
matches
which
she
had
been
trying
all
day
to
sell
but
in
vain
no
one
had
given
her
a
single
penny
The
snow
fell
fast
upon
her
pretty
yellow
hair
and
her
bare
neck
but
she
did
not
mind
that
She
looked
wistfully
at
the
bright
lights
which
shone
from
every
window
as
she
passed
along
she
could
smell
the
nice
roast
goose
and
she
longed
to
taste
it
it
was
New
Year
s
Eve
Wearied
and
faint
she
laid
herself
down
in
a
corner
of
the
street
and
drew
her
little
legs
under
her
to
keep
herself
warm
She
could
not
go
home
for
her
father
would
scold
her
for
not
having
sold
any
matches
and
even
if
she
were
there
she
would
still
be
cold
for
the
house
was
but
poorly
protected
and
the
wind
whistled
through
many
a
chink
in
the
roof
and
walls
She
thought
she
would
try
and
warm
her
cold
fingers
by
lighting
one
of
the
matches
she
drew
one
out
struck
it
against
the
wall
and
immediately
a
bright
clear
flame
streamed
from
it
like
a
little
candle
The
little
girl
looked
at
the
flame
and
she
saw
before
her
a
beautiful
brass
stove
with
a
nice
warm
fire
in
it
She
stretched
out
her
feet
to
warm
them
when
lo
the
match
went
out
in
a
moment
the
stove
and
fire
vanished
she
sat
again
in
the
cold
night
with
the
burnt
match
in
her
hand
She
struck
another
the
flame
blazed
on
the
opposite
wall
and
she
saw
through
it
into
a
room
where
a
table
was
laid
out
with
handsome
dishes
roast
goose
and
other
nice
things
were
there
and
what
was
still
more
extraordinary
she
saw
the
goose
jump
from
the
dish
knife
and
fork
and
all
and
come
running
towards
her
But
again
the
match
went
out
and
nothing
but
the
dark
wall
and
the
cold
street
were
to
be
seen
The
little
girl
drew
another
match
and
as
soon
as
it
struck
a
light
she
saw
a
most
beautiful
Christmas
tree
much
larger
and
more
splendid
than
any
she
had
ever
seen
before
A
vast
number
of
lighted
candles
hung
among
the
branches
and
a
multitude
of
pretty
variegated
pictures
like
those
in
the
shops
met
her
eyes
The
girl
lifted
up
her
little
hands
in
rapture
at
the
sight
but
again
the
match
fell
and
in
the
same
moment
one
of
the
blazing
candles
shot
through
the
sky
like
a
falling
star
and
fell
at
her
feet
Now
some
one
dies
cried
she
for
she
had
been
told
by
her
good
old
grandmother
that
when
a
star
falls
a
soul
returns
to
God
Again
she
struck
and
behold
a
bright
light
shone
round
about
her
and
in
the
midst
of
it
stood
her
kind
grandmother
looking
calmly
and
smilingly
upon
her
Dear
grandmother
said
she
take
me
oh
take
me
You
will
be
gone
from
me
when
the
match
goes
out
like
the
bright
stove
the
nice
supper
and
the
Christmas
tree
and
saying
this
she
struck
all
the
rest
of
the
matches
at
once
which
made
a
light
round
her
almost
like
day
And
now
the
good
grandmother
smiled
still
more
sweetly
upon
her
she
lifted
her
up
in
her
arms
and
they
soared
together
far
far
away
where
there
was
no
longer
any
cold
or
hunger
or
pain
they
were
in
Paradise
But
the
poor
little
match
girl
was
still
in
the
corner
of
the
street
in
the
cold
New
Year
s
morning
She
was
frozen
to
death
and
a
bundle
of
burnt
matches
lay
beside
her
People
said
She
has
been
trying
to
warm
herself
poor
thing
But
ah
they
knew
not
what
glorious
things
she
had
seen
they

THE
RHINOCEROS
Next
to
the
mighty
elephant
the
rhinoceros
is
the
largest
and
strongest
of
animals
There
are
several
species
of
the
rhinoceros
some
of
which
are
found
in
Asia
and
others
in
different
parts
of
Africa
In
the
latter
country
there
are
four
varieties
the
black
rhinoceros
having
a
single
horn
a
black
species
having
two
horns
the
long
horned
white
rhinoceros
and
the
common
white
species
which
has
a
short
stubby
horn
The
largest
of
the
African
species
is
the
long
horned
white
or
square
nosed
rhinoceros
When
full
grown
it
sometimes
measures
eighteen
feet
in
length
and
about
as
many
feet
around
the
body
Its
horn
frequently
grows
to
the
length
of
thirty
inches
The
black
rhinoceros
although
much
smaller
than
the
white
and
seldom
having
a
horn
over
eighteen
inches
long
is
far
more
ferocious
than
the
white
species
and
possesses
a
wonderful
degree
of
strength
The
form
of
the
rhinoceros
is
clumsy
and
its
appearance
dull
and
heavy
The
limbs
are
thick
and
powerful
and
each
foot
has
three
toes
which
are
covered
with
broad
hoof
like
nails
The
tail
is
small
the
head
very
long
and
large
Taken
altogether
there
are
few
if
any
animals
that
compare
with
the
rhinoceros
in
ugliness
The
eyes
are
set
in
such
a
manner
that
the
animal
can
not
see
anything
exactly
in
front
of
it
but
the
senses
of
hearing
and
smelling
are
so
keen
that
sight
is
not
required
to
detect
an
enemy
whether
it
be
man
or
beast
The
skin
of
the
African
rhinoceros
is
smooth
and
has
only
a
few
scattering
hairs
here
and
there
It
is
however
very
thick
and
tough
and
can
resist
the
force
of
a
rifle
ball
except
when
it
is
fired
from
a
very
short
distance
The
largest
known
species
of
the
rhinoceros
is
found
in
Asia
It
lives
chiefly
in
the
marshy
jungles
and
on
the
banks
of
lakes
and
rivers
in
India
Some
of
this
species
are
over
five
feet
in
height
and
have
horns
three
feet
in
length
and
eighteen
inches
around
the
base
Unlike
that
of
the
African
rhinoceros
the
skin
of
the
Asiatic
species
is
not
smooth
but
lies
in
thick
folds
upon
the
body
forming
flaps
which
can
be
lifted
with
the
hand
The
food
of
the
rhinoceros
consists
of
roots
and
the
young
branches
and
leaves
of
trees
and
shrubs
It
ploughs
up
the
roots
with
the
aid
of
its
horn
and
gathers
the
branches
and
leaves
with
its
upper
lip
which
is
long
and
pointed
and
with
it
rolls
its
food
together
before
placing
it
in
its
mouth
The
flesh
of
the
rhinoceros
is
good
to
eat
and
its
strong
thick
skin
is
made
by
the
natives
into
shields
whips
and
other
articles
Though
clumsy
and
apparently
very
stupid
the
rhinoceros
is
a
very
active
animal
when
attacked
or
otherwise
alarmed
It
is
very
fierce
and
savage
so
much
so
that
the
natives
dread
it
more
than
they
do
the
lion
In
hunting
the
rhinoceros
it
is
dangerous
for
a
man
to
fire
at
one
unless
he
is
mounted
upon
a
swift
horse
and
can
easily
reach
some
place
of
safety
When
attacking
an
enemy
the
rhinoceros
lowers
its
head
and
rushes
forward
like
an
angry
bull
Though
it
may
not
see
the
object
of
its
attack
its
sense
of
smell
is
so
acute
that
it
knows
when
the
enemy
is
reached
Then
begins
a
furious
tossing
of
the
head
and
if
its
powerful
horn
strikes
the
foe
a
terrible
wound
is
the
result
When
wounded
itself
the
rhinoceros
loses
all
sense
of
fear
and
charges
again
and
again
with
such
desperate
fury
that
the
enemy
is
almost
always
overcome
Illustration
A
famous
traveller
in
South
Africa
relates
the
following
incident
that
happened
during
one
of
his
hunting
excursions
Having
proceeded
about
two
miles
I
came
upon
a
black
rhinoceros
feeding
within
fifty
yards
of
me
I
fired
from
my
saddle
and
sent
a
bullet
in
behind
his
shoulder
upon
which
he
rushed
forward
blowing
like
a
grampus
and
then
stood
looking
about
him
Presently
he
started
off
and
I
followed
I
expected
that
he
would
come
to
bay
but
it
seems
a
rhinoceros
never
does
that
a
fact
I
did
not
know
at
that
time
Suddenly
he
fell
flat
upon
the
ground
but
soon
recovering
his
feet
he
resumed
his
course
as
if
nothing
had
happened
I
spurred
on
my
horse
dashed
ahead
and
rode
right
in
his
path
Upon
this
the
hideous
monster
charged
me
in
the
most
resolute
manner
blowing
loudly
through
his
nostrils
Although
I
quickly
turned
about
he
followed
me
at
such
a
furious
pace
for
several
hundred
yards
with
his
horrid
horny
snout
within
a
few
yards
of
my
horse
s
tail
that
I
thought
my
destruction
was
certain
The
animal
however
suddenly
turned
and
ran
in
another
direction
I
had
now
become
so
excited
with
the
incident
that
I
determined
to
give
him
one
more
shot
any
way
Nerving
my
horse
again
I
made
another
dash
after
the
rhinoceros
and
coming
up
pretty
close
to
him
I
again
fired
though
with
little
effect
the
ball
striking
some
thick
portion
of
the
skin
and
doing
no
harm
Not
caring
to
run
the
chance
of
the
huge
brute
again
charging
me
and
believing
that
my
rifle
ball
was
not
powerful
enough
to
kill
him
I
determined
to
give
up
the
pursuit
and
accordingly
let
him
run
off
while
I
returned
to
the
camp

THE
OLD
ARM
CHAIR
ELIZA
COOK
I
love
it
I
love
it
and
who
shall
dare
To
chide
me
for
loving
that
old
arm
chair
I
ve
treasured
it
long
as
a
sainted
prize
I
ve
bedewed
it
with
tears
and
embalmed
it
with
sighs
Tis
bound
by
a
thousand
bands
to
my
heart
Not
a
tie
will
break
not
a
link
will
start
Would
you
learn
the
spell
a
mother
sat
there
And
a
sacred
thing
is
that
old
arm
chair
In
childhood
s
hour
I
lingered
near
The
hallowed
seat
with
listening
ear
And
gentle
words
that
mother
would
give
To
fit
me
to
die
and
teach
me
to
live
She
told
me
shame
would
never
betide
With
truth
for
my
creed
and
God
for
my
guide
She
taught
me
to
lisp
my
earliest
prayer
As
I
knelt
beside
that
old
arm
chair
I
sat
and
watched
her
many
a
day
When
her
eyes
grew
dim
and
her
locks
were
gray
And
I
almost
worshipped
her
when
she
smiled
And
turned
from
her
Bible
to
bless
her
child
Years
rolled
on
but
the
last
one
sped
My
idol
was
shattered
my
earth
star
fled
I
learned
how
much
the
heart
can
bear
When
I
saw
her
die
in
that
old
arm
chair
Tis
past
tis
past
but
I
gaze
on
it
now
With
quivering
breath
and
throbbing
brow
Twas
there
she
nursed
me
twas
there
she
died
And
memory
flows
with
lava
tide
Say
it
is
folly
and
deem
me
weak
While
the
scalding
drops
start
down
my
cheek
But
I
love
it
I
love
it
and
cannot
tear
My
soul
from
a
mother
s
old
arm
chair

XV
PRINCE
ARTHUR
DICKENS
At
two
and
thirty
years
of
age
in
the
year
John
became
king
of
England
His
pretty
little
nephew
Arthur
had
the
best
claim
to
the
throne
but
John
seized
the
treasure
and
made
fine
promises
to
the
nobility
and
got
himself
crowned
at
Westminster
within
a
few
weeks
after
his
brother
Richard
s
death
I
doubt
whether
the
crown
could
possibly
have
been
put
upon
the
head
of
a
meaner
coward
or
a
more
detestable
villain
if
the
country
had
been
searched
from
end
to
end
to
find
him
out
The
French
king
Philip
refused
to
acknowledge
the
right
of
John
to
his
new
dignity
and
declared
in
favor
of
Arthur
You
must
not
suppose
that
he
had
any
generosity
of
feeling
for
the
fatherless
boy
it
merely
suited
his
ambitious
schemes
to
oppose
the
king
of
England
So
John
and
the
French
king
went
to
war
about
Arthur
He
was
a
handsome
boy
at
that
time
only
twelve
years
old
He
was
not
born
when
his
father
Geoffrey
had
his
brains
trampled
out
at
the
tournament
and
besides
the
misfortune
of
never
having
known
a
father
s
guidance
and
protection
he
had
the
additional
misfortune
to
have
a
foolish
mother
Constance
by
name
lately
married
to
her
third
husband
She
took
Arthur
upon
John
s
accession
to
the
French
king
who
pretended
to
be
very
much
his
friend
and
made
him
a
knight
and
promised
him
his
daughter
in
marriage
but
who
cared
so
little
about
him
in
reality
that
finding
it
his
interest
to
make
peace
with
King
John
for
a
time
he
did
so
without
the
least
consideration
for
the
poor
little
prince
and
heartlessly
sacrificed
all
his
interests
Young
Arthur
for
two
years
afterwards
lived
quietly
and
in
the
course
of
that
time
his
mother
died
But
the
French
king
then
finding
it
his
interest
to
quarrel
with
King
John
again
made
Arthur
his
pretence
and
invited
the
orphan
boy
to
court
You
know
your
rights
prince
said
the
French
king
and
you
would
like
to
be
a
king
Is
it
not
so
Truly
said
Prince
Arthur
I
should
greatly
like
to
be
a
king
Then
said
Philip
you
shall
have
two
hundred
gentlemen
who
are
knights
of
mine
and
with
them
you
shall
go
to
win
back
the
provinces
belonging
to
you
of
which
your
uncle
the
usurping
king
of
England
has
taken
possession
I
myself
meanwhile
will
head
a
force
against
him
in
Normandy
Prince
Arthur
went
to
attack
the
town
of
Mirebeau
because
his
grandmother
Eleanor
was
living
there
and
because
his
knights
said
Prince
if
you
can
take
her
prisoner
you
will
be
able
to
bring
the
king
your
uncle
to
terms
But
she
was
not
to
be
easily
taken
She
was
old
enough
by
this
time
eighty
but
she
was
as
full
of
stratagem
as
she
was
full
of
years
and
wickedness
Receiving
intelligence
of
young
Arthur
s
approach
she
shut
herself
up
in
a
high
tower
and
encouraged
her
soldiers
to
defend
it
like
men
Prince
Arthur
with
his
little
army
besieged
the
high
tower
King
John
hearing
how
matters
stood
came
up
to
the
rescue
with
his
army
So
here
was
a
strange
family
party
The
boy
prince
besieging
his
grandmother
and
his
uncle
besieging
him
This
position
of
affairs
did
not
last
long
One
summer
night
King
John
by
treachery
got
his
men
into
the
town
surprised
Prince
Arthur
s
force
took
two
hundred
of
his
knights
and
seized
the
prince
himself
in
his
bed
The
knights
were
put
in
heavy
irons
and
driven
away
in
open
carts
drawn
by
bullocks
to
various
dungeons
where
they
were
most
inhumanly
treated
and
where
some
of
them
were
starved
to
death
Prince
Arthur
was
sent
to
the
Castle
of
Falaise
One
day
while
he
was
in
prison
at
that
castle
mournfully
thinking
it
strange
that
one
so
young
should
be
in
so
much
trouble
and
looking
out
of
the
small
window
in
the
deep
dark
wall
at
the
summer
sky
and
the
birds
the
door
was
softly
opened
and
he
saw
his
uncle
the
king
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
archway
looking
very
grim
Arthur
said
the
king
with
his
wicked
eyes
more
on
the
stone
floor
than
on
his
nephew
will
you
not
trust
to
the
gentleness
the
friendship
and
the
truthfulness
of
your
loving
uncle
I
will
tell
my
loving
uncle
that
replied
the
boy
when
he
does
me
right
Let
him
restore
to
me
my
kingdom
of
England
and
then
come
to
me
and
ask
the
question
The
king
looked
at
him
and
went
out
Keep
that
boy
a
close
prisoner
said
he
to
the
warden
of
the
castle
Then
the
king
took
secret
counsel
with
the
worst
of
his
nobles
how
the
prince
was
to
be
got
rid
of
Some
said
Put
out
his
eyes
and
keep
him
in
prison
as
Robert
of
Normandy
was
kept
Others
said
Have
him
stabbed
Others
Have
him
poisoned
King
John
feeling
that
in
any
case
whatever
was
done
afterwards
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
his
mind
to
have
those
handsome
eyes
burnt
out
that
had
looked
at
him
so
proudly
while
his
own
royal
eyes
were
blinking
at
the
stone
floor
sent
certain
ruffians
to
Falaise
to
blind
the
boy
with
red
hot
irons
But
Arthur
so
pathetically
entreated
them
and
shed
such
piteous
tears
and
so
appealed
to
Hubert
de
Bourg
or
Burgh
the
warden
of
the
castle
who
had
a
love
for
him
and
was
a
merciful
tender
man
that
Hubert
could
not
bear
it
To
his
eternal
honor
he
prevented
the
torture
from
being
performed
and
at
his
own
risk
sent
the
savages
away
The
chafed
and
disappointed
king
bethought
himself
of
the
stabbing
suggestion
next
and
with
his
shuffling
manner
and
his
cruel
face
proposed
it
to
one
William
de
Bray
I
am
a
gentleman
and
not
an
executioner
said
William
de
Bray
and
left
the
presence
with
disdain
But
it
was
not
difficult
for
a
king
to
hire
a
murderer
in
those
days
King
John
found
one
for
his
money
and
sent
him
down
to
the
castle
of
Falaise
On
what
errand
dost
thou
come
said
Hubert
to
this
fellow
To
despatch
young
Arthur
he
returned
Go
back
to
him
who
sent
thee
answered
Hubert
and
say
that
I
will
do
it
King
John
very
well
knowing
that
Hubert
would
never
do
it
but
that
he
evasively
sent
this
reply
to
save
the
prince
or
gain
time
despatched
messengers
to
convey
the
young
prisoner
to
the
castle
of
Rouen
Arthur
was
soon
forced
from
the
kind
Hubert
of
whom
he
had
never
stood
in
greater
need
than
then
carried
away
by
night
and
lodged
in
his
new
prison
where
through
his
grated
window
he
could
hear
the
deep
waters
of
the
river
Seine
rippling
against
the
stone
wall
below
One
dark
night
as
he
lay
sleeping
dreaming
perhaps
of
rescue
by
those
unfortunate
gentlemen
who
were
obscurely
suffering
and
dying
in
his
cause
he
was
roused
and
bidden
by
his
jailor
to
come
down
the
staircase
to
the
foot
of
the
tower
He
hurriedly
dressed
himself
and
obeyed
When
they
came
to
the
bottom
of
the
winding
stairs
the
jailor
trod
upon
his
torch
and
put
it
out
Then
Arthur
in
the
darkness
was
hurriedly
drawn
into
a
solitary
boat
and
in
that
boat
he
found
his
uncle
and
one
other
man
He
knelt
to
them
and
prayed
them
not
to
murder
him
Deaf
to
his
entreaties
they
stabbed
him
and
sank
his
body
in
the
river
with
heavy
stones
When
the
spring
morning
broke
the
tower
door
was
closed
the
boat
was
gone
the
river
sparkled
on
its
way
and
never
more
was
any
trace
of
the
poor
boy
beheld
by
mortal
eyes

the
churchyard
laid
Then
you
are
only
five
Their
graves
are
green
they
may
be
seen
The
little
maid
replied
Twelve
steps
or
more
from
my
mother
s
door
And
they
are
side
by
side
My
stockings
there
I
often
knit
My
kerchief
there
I
hem
And
there
upon
the
ground
I
sit
I
sit
and
sing
to
them
And
often
after
sunset
sir
When
it
is
light
and
fair
I
take
my
little
porringer
And
eat
my
supper
there
The
first
that
died
was
little
Jane
In
bed
she
moaning
lay
Till
God
released
her
of
her
pain
And
then
she
went
away
So
in
the
churchyard
she
was
laid
And
when
the
grass
was
dry
Together
round
her
grave
we
played
My
brother
John
and
I
And
when
the
ground
was
white
with
snow
And
I
could
run
and
slide
My
brother
John
was
forced
to
go
And
he
lies
by
her
side
How
many
are
you
then
said
I
If
they
two
are
in
heaven
The
little
maiden
did
reply
O
master
we
are
seven
But
they
are
dead
those
two
are
dead
Their
spirits
are
in
heaven
Twas
throwing
words
away
for
still
The
little
maid
would
have
her
will
And
said
Nay
we
are
seven
XVIII
THE
HIPPOPOTAMUS
Illustration
Of
all
the
ugly
looking
animals
the
hippopotamus
is
certainly
one
of
the
ugliest
Its
name
means
the
river
horse
and
was
given
it
because
it
is
generally
found
either
in
rivers
or
their
neighborhood
but
the
hippopotamus
is
nothing
like
a
horse
either
in
its
form
or
its
habits
Though
it
rarely
exceeds
five
feet
in
height
it
is
of
vast
bulk
and
when
full
grown
will
weigh
it
is
said
as
much
as
four
or
five
oxen
The
head
is
of
enormous
size
and
provided
with
a
mouth
of
alarming
width
The
skin
which
is
of
a
dark
color
and
thinly
covered
with
short
white
hairs
is
in
places
nearly
two
inches
thick
The
feet
are
large
and
divided
into
four
parts
each
of
which
is
protected
by
a
hoof
The
hippopotamus
lives
entirely
upon
vegetable
food
of
which
it
eats
vast
quantities
as
much
as
six
bushels
of
grass
having
been
found
in
its
stomach
But
it
is
not
so
much
the
amount
of
food
which
it
consumes
as
what
it
destroys
that
makes
the
African
dread
its
visits
to
the
standing
crops
Its
body
is
so
huge
and
its
legs
are
so
short
that
it
tramples
down
far
more
than
it
eats
It
is
provided
with
a
tremendous
array
of
teeth
some
of
which
weigh
from
five
to
eight
pounds
With
these
it
cuts
down
the
grass
and
shrubs
on
which
it
lives
as
if
they
were
mown
with
a
scythe
The
hippopotamus
in
spite
of
its
awkward
form
is
an
excellent
swimmer
and
diver
and
can
remain
under
water
for
as
much
as
ten
minutes
During
the
first
few
months
of
its
life
the
young
hippopotamus
is
carried
upon
its
mother
s
neck
When
born
it
is
not
much
larger
than
a
terrier
dog
The
hippopotamus
is
caught
in
various
ways
Sometimes
several
pitfalls
having
sharp
stakes
at
the
bottom
are
dug
across
the
path
which
it
pursues
In
the
darkness
of
the
night
it
falls
into
one
of
these
and
is
impaled
on
the
stakes
This
is
a
very
cruel
mode
of
capture
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
natives
who
employ
it
soon
put
the
poor
animal
out
of
its
misery
It
is
not
easy
to
shoot
it
fatally
for
once
it
is
alarmed
it
does
not
readily
show
itself
It
just
pushes
up
its
nostrils
above
the
water
to
take
in
air
often
selecting
for
this
purpose
some
spot
where
the
reeds
conceal
its
movements
and
then
sinks
again
Sometimes
the
hippopotamus
is
harpooned
like
a
whale
As
soon
as
it
is
struck
with
the
harpoon
the
hunters
fasten
the
line
round
a
neighboring
tree
and
so
hold
their
prey
tight
until
it
is
despatched
Or
if
there
is
no
time
for
them
to
get
to
land
they
throw
the
line
with
a
buoy
attached
to
it
into
the
water
The
hippopotamus
is
then
pursued
in
canoes
and
every
time
it
rises
to
the
surface
it
is
pierced
with
javelins
until
at
length
it
dies
from
loss
of
blood
This
is
dangerous
sport
for
it
sometimes
turns
upon
the
hunters
and
crushes
in
or
capsizes
their
canoes
Once
a
hippopotamus
whose
calf
had
been
speared
on
the
previous
day
attacked
a
boat
in
which
was
Dr
Livingstone
She
struck
it
with
such
violence
that
the
forepart
was
lifted
clean
out
of
the
water
one
of
the
negro
boatmen
was
thrown
into
the
river
and
the
whole
crew
were
forced
to
jump
ashore
Between
the
skin
and
the
flesh
is
a
layer
of
fat
which
is
considered
a
great
delicacy
The
flesh
also
is
very
good
eating
The
hide
is
made
into
shields
whips
and
walking
sticks
The
teeth
yield
a
beautiful
white
ivory
which
is
much
valued
on
account
of
its
never
losing
color

A
BRIGHT
BOY
PROF
J
S
BLACKIE
Bill
is
a
bright
boy
Do
you
know
Bill
Marching
cheerily
Up
and
down
hill
Bill
is
a
bright
boy
At
books
and
at
play
A
right
and
a
tight
boy
All
the
boys
say
His
face
is
like
roses
In
flush
of
the
June
His
eyes
like
the
welkin
When
cloudless
the
noon
His
step
is
like
fountains
That
bicker
with
glee
Beneath
the
green
mountains
Down
to
the
sea
When
Bill
plays
at
cricket
No
ball
on
the
green
Is
shot
from
the
wicket
So
sharp
and
so
clean
He
stands
at
his
station
As
strong
as
a
king
When
he
lifts
up
a
nation
On
Victory
s
wing
When
bent
upon
study
He
girds
to
his
books
No
frown
ever
ploughs
The
smooth
pride
of
his
looks
I
came
and
I
saw
And
I
conquered
at
will
This
be
the
law
For
great
C
sar
and
Bill
Like
Thor
with
the
hammer
Of
power
in
his
hand
He
rides
through
the
grammar
Triumphant
and
grand
O
er
bastions
and
brambles
Which
pedants
up
pile
He
leaps
and
he
ambles
Along
with
a
smile
As
mild
as
a
maiden
Where
mildness
belongs
He
s
hot
as
Achilles
When
goaded
by
wrongs
He
flirts
with
a
danger
He
sports
with
an
ill
To
fear
such
a
stranger
Is
brave
hearted
Bill
For
Bill
is
a
bright
boy
Who
is
like
Bill
Oft
have
I
marched
with
him
Up
and
down
hill
When
I
hear
his
voice
calling
I
follow
him
still
And
standing
or
falling
I
conquer
with
Bill
Do
good
by
stealth

blush

find

AFTER
BLENHEIM
ROBERT
SOUTHEY
Illustration
It
was
a
summer
evening
Old
Kaspar
s
work
was
done
And
he
before
his
cottage
door
Was
sitting
in
the
sun
And
by
him
sported
on
the
green
His
little
grandchild
Wilhelmine
She
saw
her
brother
Peterkin
Roll
something
large
and
round
Which
he
beside
the
rivulet
In
playing
there
had
found
He
came
to
ask
what
he
had
found
That
was
so
large
and
smooth
and
round
Old
Kaspar
took
it
from
the
boy
Who
stood
expectant
by
And
then
the
old
man
shook
his
head
And
with
a
natural
sigh
Tis
some
poor
fellow

skull
said
he
Who
fell
in
the
great
victory
I
find
them
in

For
there

And
often

The

For

Now

Young

Now

And
what
they
fought

It
was

cried
Who
put

But
what
they

I

But
everybody

That

My

lived
at
Blenheim
then
Yon

They
burnt
his

And
he

So
with

fled
Nor

With

the

THE
BLACK
DOUGLAS
Illustration
King
Edward
I
of
England
commonly
known
as
Longshanks
nearly
conquered
Scotland
It
was
from
no
lack
of
spirit
or
energy
that
he
did
not
quite
complete
his
troublesome
task
but
he
died
a
little
too
soon
On
his
death
bed
he
called
his
pretty
spiritless
son
to
him
and
made
him
promise
to
carry
on
the
war
he
then
ordered
that
his
bones
should
be
wrapped
up
in
a
bull
s
hide
and
carried
at
the
head
of
the
army
in
future
campaigns
against
the
Scots
Edward
II
soon
forgot
his
promise
to
his
father
and
spent
his
time
in
dissipation
among
his
favorites
and
allowed
the
resolute
Scots
to
recover
Scotland
Good
James
Lord
Douglas
was
a
very
wise
man
in
his
day
He
may
not
have
had
long
shanks
but
he
had
a
very
long
head
as
you
shall
presently
see
He
was
one
of
the
hardest
foes
with
which
the
two
Edwards
had
to
contend
and
his
long
head
proved
quite
too
powerful
for
the
second
Edward
who
in
his
single
campaign
against
the
Scots
lost
at
Bannockburn
nearly
all
that
his
father
had
gained
The
tall
Scottish
castle
of
Roxburgh
stood
near
the
border
lifting
its
grim
turrets
above
the
Teviot
and
the
Tweed
When
the
Black
Douglas
as
Lord
James
was
called
had
recovered
castle
after
castle
from
the
English
he
desired
to
gain
this
stronghold
and
determined
to
accomplish
his
wish
But
he
knew
it
could
be
taken
only
by
surprise
and
a
very
wily
affair
it
must
be
He
had
outwitted
the
English
so
many
times
that
they
were
sharply
on
the
look
out
for
him
How
could
it
be
done
Tis
an
old
Yule
log
story
and
you
shall
be
told
Near
the
castle
was
a
gloomy
old
forest
called
Jedburgh
Here
just
as
the
first
days
of
spring
began
to
kindle
in
the
sunrise
and
the
sunsets
and
warm
the
frosty
hills
Black
Douglas
concealed
sixty
picked
men
It
was
Shrove
tide
and
Fasten
s
Eve
immediately
before
the
great
Church
fast
of
Lent
was
to
be
celebrated
with
song
and
harp
and
a
great
blaze
of
light
and
free
offerings
of
wine
in
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
The
garrison
was
to
have
leave
for
merry
making
and
indulging
in
drunken
wassail
The
sun
had
gone
down
in
the
red
sky
and
the
long
deep
shadow
began
to
fall
on
Jedburgh
woods
the
river
the
hills
and
valleys
An
officer
s
wife
had
retired
from
the
great
hall
where
all
was
preparation
for
the
merry
making
to
the
high
battlements
of
the
castle
in
order
to
quiet
her
little
child
and
put
it
to
rest
The
sentinel
from
time
to
time
paced
near
her
She
began
to
sing
Hush
ye
hush
ye
little
pet
ye
Hush
ye
hush
ye
do
not
fret
ye
The
Black
Douglas
shall
not
get
ye
She
saw
some
strange
objects
moving
across
the
level
ground
in
the
distance
They
greatly
puzzled
her
They
did
not
travel
quite
like
animals
but
they
seemed
to
have
four
legs
What
are
those
queer
looking
things
yonder
she
asked
of
the
sentinel
as
he
drew
near
They
are
Farmer
Asher
s
cattle
said
the
soldier
straining
his
eyes
to
discern
the
outlines
of
the
long
figures
in
the
shadows
The
good
man
is
making
merry
to
night
and
has
forgotten
to
bring
in
his
oxen
lucky
twill
be
if
they
do
not
fall
a
prey
to
the
Black
Douglas
So
sure
was
he
that
the
objects
were
cattle
that
he
ceased
to
watch
them
longer
The
woman
s
eye
however
followed
the
queer
looking
cattle
for
some
time
until
they
seemed
to
disappear
under
the
outer
works
of
the
castle
Then
feeling
quite
at
ease
she
thought
she
would
sing
again
Spring
was
in
the
evening
air
and
perhaps
it
was
the
joyousness
of
spring
which
made
her
sing
Now
the
name
of
the
Black
Douglas
had
become
so
terrible
to
the
English
that
it
was
used
to
frighten
the
children
who
when
they
misbehaved
were
told
that
the
Black
Douglas
would
get
them
The
little
ditty
I
have
quoted
must
have
been
very
quieting
to
good
children
in
those
alarming
times
So
the
good
woman
sang
cheerily
Hush
ye
hush
ye
little
pet
ye
Hush
ye
hush
ye
do
not
fret
ye
The
Black
Douglas
shall
not
get
ye
Do
not
be
so
sure
of
that
said
a
husky
voice
close
beside
her
and
a
mail
gloved
hand
fell
solidly
upon
her
shoulder
She
was
dreadfully
frightened
for
she
knew
from
the
appearance
of
the
man
he
must
be
the
Black
Douglas
The
Scots
came
leaping
over
the
walls
The
garrison
was
merry
making
below
and
almost
before
the
disarmed
revellers
had
any
warning
the
Black
Douglas
was
in
the
midst
of
them
The
old
stronghold
was
taken
and
many
of
the
garrison
were
put
to
the
sword
but
the
Black
Douglas
spared
the
woman
and
the
child
who
probably
never
afterwards
felt
quite
so
sure
about
the
little
ditty
Hush
ye
hush
ye
do
not
fret
ye
The
Black
Douglas
shall
not
get
ye
Douglas
had
caused
his
picked
men
to
approach
the
castle
by
walking
on
their
hands
and
knees
with
long
black
cloaks
thrown
over
their
bodies
and
their
ladders
and
weapons
concealed
under
their
cloaks
The
men
thus
presented
very
nearly
the
appearance
of
a
herd
of
cattle
in
the
deep
shadows
and
completely
deceived
the
sentinel
who
was
probably
thinking
more
of
the
music
and
dancing
below
than
of
the
watchful
enemy
who
had
been
haunting
the
gloomy
woods
of
Jedburgh
The
Black
Douglas
or
Good
James
Lord
Douglas
as
he
was
called
by
the
Scots
fought
as
you
will
afterwards
read
with
King
Robert
Bruce
at
Bannockburn
One
lovely
June
day
in
the
far
gone
year
of
King
Robert
lay
dying
He
called
Douglas
to
his
bedside
and
told
him
that
it
had
been
one
of
the
dearest
wishes
of
his
heart
to
go
to
the
Holy
Land
and
recover
Jerusalem
from
the
Infidels
but
since
he
could
not
go
he
wished
him
to
embalm
his
heart
after
his
death
and
carry
it
to
the
Holy
City
and
deposit
it
in
the
Holy
Sepulchre
Douglas
had
the
heart
of
Bruce
embalmed
and
enclosed
in
a
silver
case
and
wore
it
on
a
silver
chain
about
his
neck
He
set
out
for
Jerusalem
but
resolved
first
to
visit
Spain
and
engage
in
the
war
waged
against
the
Moorish
king
of
Granada
He
fell
in
Andalusia
in
battle
Just
before
his
death
he
threw
the
silver
casket
into
the
thickest
of
the
fight
exclaiming
Heart
of
Bruce
I
follow
thee
or
die
His
dead
body
was
found
beside
the
casket
and
the
heart
of
Bruce
was
brought
back
to
Scotland
and
deposited
in
the
ivy
clad
Abbey
of
Melrose
Douglas
was
a
real
hero
and
few
things
more
engaging
than
his
exploits
were
ever
told
under
the
holly
and
mistletoe
or
in
the
warm
Christmas
light
of
the
old
Scottish
Yule

BRUCE
AND
THE
SPIDER
ELIZA
COOK
Illustration
King
Bruce
of
Scotland
flung
himself
down
in
a
lonely
mood
to
think
Tis
true
he
was
monarch
and
wore
a
crown
but
his
heart
was
beginning
to
sink
For
he
had
been
trying
to
do
a
great
deed
to
make
his
people
glad
He
had
tried
and
tried
but
couldn
t
succeed
and
so
he
became
quite
sad
He
flung
himself
down
in
low
despair
as
grieved
as
man
could
be
And
after
a
while
as
he
pondered
there
I
ll
give
it
all
up
said
he
Now
just
at
the
moment
a
spider
dropped
with
its
silken
cobweb
clew
And
the
king
in
the
midst
of
his
thinking
stopped
to
see
what
the
spider
would
do
Twas
a
long
way
up
to
the
ceiling
dome
and
it
hung
by
a
rope
so
fine
That
how
it
would
get
to
its
cobweb
home
King
Bruce
could
not
divine
It
soon
began
to
cling
and
crawl
straight
up
with
strong
endeavor
But
down
it
came
with
a
slipping
sprawl
as
near
to
the
ground
as
ever
Up
up
it
ran
not
a
second
it
stayed
to
utter
the
least
complaint
Till
it
fell
still
lower
and
there
it
lay
a
little
dizzy
and
faint
Its
head
grew
steady
again
it
went
and
travelled
a
half
yard
higher
Twas
a
delicate
thread
it
had
to
tread
and
a
road
where
its
feet
would
tire
Again
it
fell
and
swung
below
but
again
it
quickly
mounted
Till
up
and
down
now
fast
now
slow
nine
brave
attempts
were
counted
Sure
cried
the
king
that
foolish
thing
will
strive
no
more
to
climb
When
it
toils
so
hard
to
reach
and
cling
and
tumbles
every
time
But
up
the
insect
went
once
more
ah
me
tis
an
anxious
minute
He
s
only
a
foot
from
his
cobweb
door
oh
say
will
he
lose
or
win
it
Steadily
steadily
inch
by
inch
higher
and
higher
he
got
And
a
bold
little
run
at
the
very
last
pinch
put
him
into
his
native
spot
Bravo
bravo
the
king
cried
out
all
honor
to
those
who
try
The
spider
up
there
defied
despair
he
conquered
and
why
shouldn
t
I
And
Bruce
of
Scotland
braced
his
mind
and
gossips
tell
the
tale
That
he
tried
once
more
as
he
tried
before
and
that
time
he
did
not
fail
Pay
goodly
heed
all
you
who
read
and
beware
of
saying
I
can
t
Tis
a
cowardly
word
and
apt
to
lead
to
Idleness
Folly
and
Want
Whenever
you
find
your
heart
despair
of
doing

goodly
thing

THE
FARMER
AND
THE
FOX
J
A
FROUDE
A
Farmer
whose
poultry
yard
had
suffered
severely
from
the
foxes
succeeded
at
last
in
catching
one
in
a
trap
Ah
you
rascal
said
he
as
he
saw
him
struggling
I
ll
teach
you
to
steal
my
fat
geese
You
shall
hang
on
the
tree
yonder
and
your
brothers
shall
see
what
comes
of
thieving
The
Farmer
was
twisting
a
halter
to
do
what
he
had
threatened
when
the
Fox
whose
tongue
had
helped
him
in
hard
pinches
before
thought
there
could
be
no
harm
in
trying
if
it
might
not
do
him
one
more
good
turn
You
will
hang
me
he
said
to
frighten
my
brother
foxes
On
the
word
of
a
fox
they
won
t
care
a
rabbit
skin
for
it
they
ll
come
and
look
at
me
but
you
may
depend
upon
it
they
will
dine
at
your
expense
before
they
go
home
again
Then
I
shall
hang
you
for
yourself
as
a
rogue
and
a
rascal
said
the
Farmer
I
am
only
what
Nature
or
whatever
you
call
the
thing
chose
to
make
me
the
Fox
answered
I
didn
t
make
myself
You
stole
my
geese
said
the
man
Why
did
Nature
make
me
like
geese
then
said
the
Fox
Live
and
let
live
give
me
my
share
and
I
won
t
touch
yours
but
you
keep
them
all
to
yourself
I
don
t
understand
your
fine
talk
answered
the
Farmer
but
I
know
that
you
are
a
thief
and
that
you
deserve
to
be
hanged
His
head
is
too
thick
to
let
me
catch
him
so
thought
the
Fox
I
wonder
if
his
heart
is
any
softer
You
are
taking
away
the
life
of
a
fellow
creature
he
said
that
s
a
responsibility
it
is
a
curious
thing
that
life
and
who
knows
what
comes
after
it
You
say
I
am
a
rogue
I
say
I
am
not
but
at
any
rate
I
ought
not
to
be
hanged
for
if
I
am
not
I
don
t
deserve
it
and
if
I
am
you
should
give
me
time
to
repent
I
have
him
now
thought
the
Fox
let
him
get
out
if
he
can
Why
what
would
you
have
me
do
with
you
said
the
man
My
notion
is
that
you
should
let
me
go
and
give
me
a
lamb
or
a
goose
or
two
every
month
and
then
I
could
live
without
stealing
but
perhaps
you
know
better
than
I
and
I
am
a
rogue
my
education
may
have
been
neglected
you
should
shut
me
up
and
take
care
of
me
and
teach
me
Who
knows
but
in
the
end
I
may
turn
into
a
dog
Very
pretty
said
the
Farmer
we
have
dogs
enough
and
more
too
than
we
can
take
care
of
without
you
No
no
Master
Fox
I
have
caught
you
and
you
shall
swing
whatever
is
the
logic
of
it
There
will
be
one
rogue
less
in
the
world
any
how
It
is
mere
hate
and
unchristian
vengeance
said
the
Fox
No
friend
the
Farmer
answered
I
don
t
hate
you
and
I
don
t
want
to
revenge
myself
on
you
but
you
and
I
can
t
get
on
together
and
I
think
I
am
of
more
importance
than
you
If
nettles
and
thistles
grow
in
my
cabbage
garden
I
don
t
try
and
persuade
them
to
grow
into
cabbages
I
just
dig
them
up
I
don
t
hate
them
but
I
feel
somehow
that
they
mustn
t
hinder
me
with
my
cabbage
and
that
I
must
put
them
away
and
so
my
poor
friend
I
am
sorry
for
you
but
I
am
afraid
you
must
swing

THE
WRECK
OF
THE
HESPERUS
LONGFELLOW
It
was
the
schooner
Hesperus
That
sailed
the
wintry
sea
And
the
skipper
had
taken
his
little
daughter
To
bear
him
company
Blue
were
her
eyes
as
the
fairy
flax
Her
cheeks
like
the
dawn
of
day
And
her
bosom
white
as
the
hawthorn
buds
That
ope
in
the
month
of
May
The
skipper
he
stood
beside
the
helm
His
pipe
was
in
his
mouth
And
he
watched
how
the
veering
flaw
did
blow
The
smoke
now
west
now
south
Then
up
and
spake
an
old
sailor
Had
sailed
the
Spanish
Main
I
pray
thee
put
into
yonder
port
For
I
fear
a
hurricane
Last
night
the
moon
had
a
golden
ring
And
to
night
no
moon
we
see
The
skipper
he
blew
a
whiff
from
his
pipe
And
a
scornful
laugh
laughed
he
Colder
and
louder
blew
the
wind
A
gale
from
the
north
east
The
snow
fell
hissing
in
the
brine
And
the
billows
frothed
like
yeast
Down
came
the
storm
and
smote
amain
The
vessel
in
its
strength
She
shuddered
and
paused
like
a
frighted
steed
Then
leaped
her
cable
s
length
Come
hither
come
hither
my
little
daughter
And
do
not
tremble
so
For
I
can
weather
the
roughest
gale
That
ever
wind
did
blow
He
wrapped
her
warm
in
his
seaman
s
coat
Against
the
stinging
blast
He
cut
a
rope
from
a
broken
spar
And
bound
her
to
the
mast
O
father
I
hear
the
church
bells
ring
O
say
what
may
it
be
Tis
a
fog
bell
on
a
rock
bound
coast
And
he
steered
for
the
open
sea
O
father
I
hear
the
sound
of
guns
O
say
what
may
it
be
Some
ship
in
distress
that
cannot
live
In
such
an
angry
sea
O
father
I
see
a
gleaming
light
O
say
what
may
it
be
But
the
father
answered
never
a
word
A
frozen
corpse
was
he
Lashed
to
the
helm
all
stiff
and
stark
With
his
face
turned
to
the
skies
The
lantern
gleamed
through
the
gleaming
snow
On
his
fixed
and
glassy
eyes
Then
the
maiden
clasped
her
hands
and
prayed
That
sav
d
she
might
be
And
she
thought
of
Him
who
stilled
the
wave
On
the
Lake
of
Galilee
And
fast
through
the
midnight
dark
and
drear
Through
the
whistling
sleet
and
snow
Like
a
sheeted
ghost
the
vessel
swept
Towards
the
reef
of
Norman
s
Woe
And
ever
the
fitful
gusts
between
A
sound
came
from
the
land
It
was
the
sound
of
the
trampling
surf
On
the
rocks
and
the
hard
sea
sand
The
breakers
were
right
beneath
her
bows
She
drifted
a
dreary
wreck
And
the
whooping
billow
swept
the
crew
Like
icicles
from
her
deck
She
struck
where
the
white
and
fleecy
waves
Looked
soft
as
carded
wool
But
the
cruel
rocks
they
gored
her
side
Like
the
horns
of
an
angry
bull
Her
rattling
shrouds
all
sheathed
in
ice
With
the
masts
went
by
the
board
Like
a
vessel
of
glass
she
stove
and
sank
Ho
Ho
the
breakers
roared
At
daybreak
on
the
bleak
sea
beach
A
fisherman
stood
aghast
To
see
the
form
of
a
maiden
fair
Lashed
close
to
a
drifting
mast
The
salt
sea
was
frozen
on
her
breast
The
salt
tears
in
her
eyes
And
he
saw
her
hair
like
the
brown
sea
weed
On
the
billows
fall
and
rise
Such
was
the
wreck
of
the
Hesperus
In
the
midnight
and
the
snow
Oh
save

HOLLAND

DODGE
Dutch
cities
seem
at
first
sight
to
be
a
bewildering
jumble
of
houses
bridges
churches
and
ships
sprouting
into
masts
steeples
and
trees
In
some
cities
boats
are
hitched
like
horses
to
their
owners
door
posts
and
receive
their
freight
from
the
upper
windows
Mothers
scream
to
their
children
not
to
swing
on
the
garden
gate
for
fear
they
may
be
drowned
Water
roads
are
more
frequent
in
Holland
than
common
roads
and
railroads
water
fences
in
the
form
of
lazy
green
ditches
enclose
pleasure
ground
farm
and
garden
Sometimes
fine
green
hedges
are
seen
but
wooden
fences
such
as
we
have
are
rarely
met
with
in
Holland
As
for
stone
fences
a
Hollander
would
lift
his
hands
with
astonishment
at
the
very
idea
There
is
no
stone
there
excepting
those
great
masses
of
rock
that
have
been
brought
from
other
lands
to
strengthen
and
protect
the
coast
All
the
small
stones
or
pebbles
if
there
ever
were
any
seem
to
be
imprisoned
in
pavements
or
quite
melted
away
Boys
with
strong
quick
arms
may
grow
from
aprons
to
full
beards
without
ever
finding
one
to
start
the
water
rings
or
set
the
rabbits
flying
The
water
roads
are
nothing
less
than
canals
crossing
the
country
in
every
direction
These
are
of
all
sizes
from
the
great
North
Holland
Ship
Canal
which
is
the
wonder
of
the
world
to
those
which
a

can
leap
Water
omnibuses
constantly
ply
up
and
down
these
roads
for
the

of
passengers
and

Illustration
Instead
of
green
country

green
canals
stretch
from
field
to
barn
and
from

great
lakes
pumped
dry
Some
of
the

The

a

is
clear
you
may
think
that
the
inhabitants
need
never

thirsty
But
no
Odd
land
is
true
to
itself
still
With
the

pushing
to
get
in
and
the

struggling
to
get
out
and
the
overflowing
canals
rivers
and

in

there
is
no

that

EVENING
HYMN
JOHN
KEBLE
Sun
of
my
soul
Thou
Saviour
dear
It
is
not
night
if
Thou
be
near
Oh
may
no

cloud
arise
To
hide
Thee
from
Thy

s
eyes
When
the
soft
dews
of
kindly
sleep
My
wearied

gently
steep
Be
my

how
sweet
to
rest
For
ever
on
my
Saviour
s
breast
Abide
with
me
from
morn
till

For
without
Thee
I
cannot
live
Abide
with
me
when
night
is
nigh
For
without
Thee
I
dare
not
die
If
some
poor
wandering
child
of
Thine
Have
spurned
to
day
the
voice
divine
Now
Lord
the
gracious
work
begin
Let
him
no

lie
down
in

Watch
by
the

enrich
the
poor
With
blessings
from
Thy

Be
every

Like

Come

Ere

Till

The

THE
HEROIC
SERF
In
the
dark
forests
of
Russia
where
the
snow
lies
on
the
ground
for
eight
months
in
the
year
wolves
roam
about
in
countless
troops
and
it
is
a
fearful
thing
for
the
traveller
especially
if
night
overtakes
him
to
hear
their
famished
howlings
as
they
approach
nearer
and
nearer
to
him
A
Russian
nobleman
with
his
wife
and
a
young
daughter
was
travelling
in
a
sleigh
over
a
bleak
plain
About
nightfall
they
reached
an
inn
and
the
nobleman
called
for
a
relay
of
horses
to
go
on
The
innkeeper
begged
him
not
to
proceed
There
is
danger
ahead
said
he
the
wolves
are
out
The
traveller
thought
the
object
of
the
man
was
to
keep
him
as
a
guest
for
the
night
and
saying
it
was
too
early
in
the
season
for
wolves
ordered
the
horses
to
be
put
to
In
spite
of
the
repeated
warnings
of
the
landlord
the
party
proceeded
on
their
way
The
driver
was
a
serf
who
had
been
born
on
the
nobleman
s
estate
and
who
loved
his
master
as
he
loved
his
life
The
sleigh
sped
swiftly
over
the
hard
snow
and
there
seemed
no
signs
of
danger
The
moon
began
to
shed
her
light
so
that
the
road
seemed
like
polished
silver
Suddenly
the
little
girl
said
to
her
father
What
is
that
strange
dull
sound
I
heard
just
now
Her
father
replied
Nothing
but
the
wind
sighing
through
the
trees
The
child
shut
her
eyes
and
kept
still
for
a
while
but
in
a
few
minutes
with
a
face
pale
with
fear
she
turned
to
her
father
and
said
Surely
that
is
not
the
wind
I
hear
it
again
do
you
not
hear
it
too
Listen
The
nobleman
listened
and
far
far
away
in
the
distance
behind
him
but
distinct
enough
in
the
clear
frosty
air
he
heard
a
sound
of
which
he
knew
the
meaning
though
those
who
were
with
him
did
not
Whispering
to
the
serf
he
said
They
are
after
us
Get
ready
your
musket
and
pistols
I
will
do
the
same
We
may
yet
escape
Drive
on
drive
on
The
man
drove
wildly
on
but
nearer
ever
nearer
came
the
mournful
howling
which
the
child
had
first
heard
It
was
perfectly
clear
to
the
nobleman
that
a
pack
of
wolves
had
got
scent
and
was
in
pursuit
of
them
Meanwhile
he
tried
to
calm
the
anxious
fears
of
his
wife
and
child
At
last
the
baying
of
the
wolves
was
distinctly
heard
and
he
said
to
his
servant
When
they
come
up
with
us
single
you
out
the
leader
and
fire
I
will
single
out
the
next
and
as
soon
as
one
falls
the
rest
will
stop
to
devour
him
That
will
be
some
delay
at
least
By
this
time
they
could
see
the
pack
fast
approaching
with
their
long
measured
tread
A
large
dog
wolf
was
the
leader
The
nobleman
and
the
serf
singled
out
two
and
these
fell
The
pack
immediately
turned
on
their
fallen
comrades
and
soon
tore
them
to
pieces
The
taste
of
blood
only
made
the
others
advance
with
more
fury
and
they
were
soon
again
baying
at
the
sleigh
Again
the
nobleman
and
his
servant
fired
Two
other
wolves
fell
and
were
instantly
devoured
But
the
next
post
house
was
still
far
distant
The
nobleman
then
cried
to
the
post
boy
Let
one
of
the
horses
loose
that
we
may
gain
a
little
more
time
This
was
done
and
the
horse
was
left
on
the
road
In
a
few
minutes
they
heard
the
loud
shrieks
of
the
poor
animal
as
the
wolves
tore
him
down
The
remaining
horses
were
urged
to
their
utmost
speed
but
again
the
pack
was
in
full
pursuit
Another
horse
was
cut
loose
and
he
soon
shared
the
fate
of
his
fellow
At
length
the
servant
said
to
his
master
I
have
served
you
since
I
was
a
child
and
I
love
you
as
I
love
my
own
life
It
is
clear
to
me
that
we
can
not
all
reach
the
post
house
alive
I
am
quite
prepared
and
I
ask
you
to
let
me
die
for
you
No
no
cried
the
master
we
will
live
together
or
die
together
You
must
not
must
not
But
the
servant
had
made
up
his
mind
he
was
fully
resolved
I
shall
leave
my
wife
and
children
to
you
you
will
be
a
father
to
them
you
have
been
a
father
to
me
When
the
wolves
next
reach
us
I
will
jump
down
and
do
my
best
to
delay
their
progress
Illustration
The
sleigh
glides
on
as
fast
as
the
two
remaining
horses
can
drag
it
The
wolves
are
close
on
their
track
and
almost
up
with
them
But
what
sound
now
rings
out
sharp
and
loud
It
is
the
discharge
of
the
servant
s
pistol
At
the
same
instant
he
leaps
from
his
seat
and
falls
a
prey
to
the
wolves
But
meanwhile
the
post
house
is
reached
and
the
family
is
safe
On
the
spot
where
the
wolves
had
pulled
to
pieces
the

there
now
stands
a

erected
by

THE
OTTER
Illustration
The
otter
resembles
land
animals
in
shape
hair
and
general
conformation
and
the
aquatic
tribes
in
its
manner
of
living
and
in
its
webbed
toes
which
assist
it
in
swimming
It
swims
even
faster
than
it
runs
and
can
overtake
fishes
in
their
own
element
It
is
found
in
all
parts
of
the
world
on
tropical
islands
in
America
and
on
the
bleak
coasts
of
Alaska
and
Siberia
It
is
one
of
the
great
weasel
family
as
active
and
cunning
in
the
water
as
its
land
relations
are
in
the
field
or
in
the
farm
yard
The
fish
otter
which
is
found
around
lakes
and
rivers
in
Canada
in
the
United
States
in
South
America
and
in
wild
parts
of
Europe
is
a
famous
fisher
Its
home
is
in
the
water
but
it
can
travel
over
the
land
with
wonderful
swiftness
although
its
paws
are
webbed
It
is
very
fond
of
sliding
down
hill
On
the
slopes
by
ponds
and
rivers
it
enjoys
itself
in
a
very
odd
fashion
It
lies
with
its
fore
feet
bent
backward
and
pushes
itself
forward
with
its
hind
feet
going
down
the
snowy
or
muddy
slope
with
as
much
pleasure
as
if
it
were
a
schoolboy
coasting
A
number
of
fish
otters
thus
amusing
themselves
must
present
a
very
ludicrous
sight
These
furry
little
quadrupeds
can
stay
a
long
time
under
water
swimming
swiftly
and
without
noise
so
that
the
fish
they
follow
seldom
escape
them
If
the
prey
is
small
the
otters
do
not
trouble
themselves
to
go
far
with
it
but
bite
off
the
most
delicate
morsels
and
throw
the
rest
away
When
they
catch
a
large
fish
however
they
drag
it
ashore
and
feed
upon
it
at
their
leisure
When
fish
are
not
plentiful
enough
the
otters
grown
bold
from
necessity
will
attack
ducks
or
any
other
waterfowl
within
reach
They
are
so
strong
and
bite
so
fiercely
that
the
animals
they
pursue
may
well
regard
them
with
terror
Their
habitations
are
really
safe
hiding
places
They
burrow
under
the
ground
and
make
the
entrance
of
their
nest
under
water
so
that
no
land
enemies
can
pursue
them
certainly
no
water
foe
can
follow
them
into
the
hollow
made
by
them
in
the
bank
This
proves
that
the
crafty
nature
of
the
weasel
is
not
wanting
in
the
otter
They
dig
upward
four
or
five
feet
or
even
more
and
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
they
make
a
little
room
which
they
line
with
moss
and
grass
for
the
comfort
of
the
baby
otters
This
underground
room
has
no
need
of
windows
but
it
does
need
ventilation
and
a
minute
air
hole
leading
like
a
chimney
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
is
an
important
part
of
otter
house
building
When
taken
young
otters
can
be
tamed
and
taught
to
catch
fish
for
their
masters
being
trained
to
hunt
as
dogs
are
trained
for
the
chase
I
have
seen
one
says
Goldsmith
go
to
a
gentleman
s
pond
at
the
word
of
command
drive
up
the
fish
into
a
corner
and
having
seized
upon
the
largest
bring
it
off
in
its
mouth
to
its
master
Otters
differ
very
much
in
size
and
color
Fish
otters
are
from
two
to
three
feet
long
and
sea
otters
the
largest
of
the
family
are
somewhat
longer
These
sea
otters
are
very
much
prized
for
their
soft
glossy
black
fur
Some
of
the
species
however
are
white
with
a
yellow
tinge
others
are
dark
brown
with
yellow
spots
under
the
throat
No
doubt
all
of
you
have
seen
caps
and
gloves
and
other
coverings
made
of
the
soft
warm
fur
of
the
otter

XXXVI
A
CHILD
S
DREAM
OF
A
STAR
CHARLES
DICKENS
There
was
once
a
child
and
he
strolled
about
a
good
deal
and
thought
of
a
number
of
things
He
had
a
sister
who
was
a
child
too
and
his
constant
companion
These
two
used
to
wonder
all
day
long
They
wondered
at
the
beauty
of
the
flowers
they
wondered
at
the
height
and
blueness
of
the
sky
they
wondered
at
the
goodness
and
the
power
of
God
who
made
the
lovely
world
They
used
to
say
to
one
another
sometimes
Supposing
all
the
children
upon
earth
were
to
die
would
the
flowers
and
the
water
and
the
sky
be
sorry
They
believed
they
would
be
sorry
For
said
they
the
buds
are
the
children
of
the
flowers
and
the
little
playful
streams
that
gambol
down
the
hillsides
are
the
children
of
the
water
and
the
smallest
bright
specks
playing
at
hide
and
seek
in
the
sky
all
night
must
surely
be
the
children
of
the
stars
and
they
would
all
be
grieved
to
see
their
playmates
the
children
of
men
no
more
There
was
one
clear
shining
star
that
used
to
come
out
in
the
sky
before
the
rest
near
the
church
spire
above
the
graves
It
was
larger
and
more
beautiful
they
thought
than
all
the
others
and
every
night
they
watched
for
it
standing
hand
in
hand
at
a
window
Whoever
saw
it
first
cried
out
I
see
the
star
And
often
they
cried
out
both
together
knowing
so
well
when
it
would
rise
and
where
So
they
grew
to
be
such
friends
with
it
that
before
lying
down
on
their
beds
they
always
looked
out
once
again
to
bid
it
good
night
and
when
they
were
turning
round
to
sleep
they
used
to
say
God
bless
the
star
But
while
she
was
still
very
young
oh
very
very
young
the
sister
drooped
and
came
to
be
so
weak
that
she
could
no
longer
stand
at
the
window
at
night
and
then
the
child
looked
sadly
out
by
himself
and
when
he
saw
the
star
turned
round
and
said
to
the
patient
pale
face
on
the
bed
I
see
the
star
and
then
a
smile
would
come
upon
the
face
and
a
little
weak
voice
used
to
say
God
bless
my
brother
and
the
star
And
so
the
time
came
all
too
soon
when
the
child
looked
out
alone
and
when
there
was
no
face
on
the
bed
and
when
there
was
a
little
grave
among
the
graves
not
there
before
and
when
the
star
made
long
rays
down
towards
him
as
he
saw
it
through
his
tears
Now
these
rays
were
so
bright
and
they
seemed
to
make
such
a
shining
way
from
earth
to
heaven
that
when
the
child
went
to
his
solitary
bed
he
dreamed
about
the
star
and
dreamed
that
lying
where
he
was
he
saw
a
train
of
people
taken
up
that
sparkling
road
by
angels
And
the
star
opening
showed
him
a
great
world
of
light
where
many
more
such
angels
waited
to
receive
him
All
these
angels
who
were
waiting
turned
their
beaming
eyes
upon
the
people
who
were
carried
up
into
the
star
and
some
came
out
from
the
long
rows
in
which
they
stood
and
fell
upon
the
people
s
necks
and
kissed
them
tenderly
and
went
away
with
them
down
avenues
of
light
and
were
so
happy
in
their
company
that
lying
in
his
bed
he
wept
for
joy
But
there
were
many
angels
who
did
not
go
with
them
and
among
them
one
he
knew
The
patient
face
that
once
had
lain
upon
the
bed
was
glorified
and
radiant
but
his
heart
found
out
his
sister
among
all
the
host
His
sister
s
angel
lingered
near
the
entrance
of
the
star
and
said
to
the
leader
among
those
who
had
brought
the
people
thither
Is
my
brother
come
And
he
said
No
She
was
turning
hopefully
away
when
the
child
stretched
out
his
arms
and
cried
O
sister
I
am
here
Take
me
And
then
she
turned
her
beaming
eyes
upon
him
and
it
was
night
and
the
star
was
shining
into
the
room
making
long
rays
down
towards
him
as
he
saw
it
through
his
tears
From
that
hour
forth
the
child
looked
out
upon
the
star
as
on
the
Home
he
was
to
go
to
when
his
time
should
come
and
he
thought
that
he
did
not
belong
to
the
earth
alone
but
to
the
star
too
because
of
his
sister
s
angel
gone
before
There
was
a
baby
born
to
be
a
brother
to
the
child
and
while
he
was
so
little
that
he
never
yet
had
spoken
a
word
he
stretched
his
tiny
form
out
on
the
bed
and
died
Again
the
child
dreamed
of
the
opened
star
and
of
the
company
of
angels
and
the
train
of
people
and
the
rows
of
angels
with
their
beaming
eyes
all
turned
upon
those
people
s
faces
Said
his
sister
s
angel
to
the
leader
Is
my
brother
come
And
he
said
Not
that
one
but
another
As
the
child
beheld
his
brother
s
angel
in
her
arms
he
cried
O
sister
I
am
here
Take
me
And
she
turned
and
smiled
upon
him
and
the
star
was
shining
He
grew
to
be
a
young
man
and
was
busy
at
his
books
when
an
old
servant
came
to
him
and
said
Thy
mother
is
no
more
I
bring
her
blessing
on
her
darling
son
Again
at
night
he
saw
the
star
and
all
the
former
company
Said
his
sister
s
angel
to
the
leader
Is
my
brother
come
And
he
said
Thy
mother
A
mighty
cry
of
joy
went
forth
through
all
the
star
because
the
mother
was
reunited
to
her
two
children
And
he
stretched
out
his
arms
and
cried
O
mother
sister
and
brother
I
am
here
Take
me
And
they
answered
him
Not
yet
and
the
star
was
shining
He
grew
to
be
a
man
whose
hair
was
turning
gray
and
he
was
sitting
in
his
chair
by
the
fireside
heavy
with
grief
and
with
his
face
bedewed
with
tears
when
the
star
opened
once
again
Said
his
sister
s
angel
to
the
leader
Is
my
brother
come
And
he
said
Nay
but
his
maiden
daughter
And
the
man
who
had
been
the
child
saw
his
daughter
newly
lost
to
him
a
celestial
creature
among
those
three
and
he
said
My
daughter
s
head
is
on
my
sister
s
bosom
and
her
arm
is
round
my
mother
s
neck
and
at
her
feet
there
is
the
baby
of
old
time
and
I
can
bear
the
parting
from
her
God
be
praised
And
the
star
was
shining
Thus
the
child
came
to
be
an
old
man
and
his
face
was
wrinkled
and
his
steps
were
slow
and
his
back
was
bent
And
one
night
as
he
lay
upon
his
bed
his
children
standing
around
he
cried
as
he
had
cried
so
long
ago
I
see
the
star
They
whispered
to
one
another
He
is
dying
And
he
said
I
am
My
age
is
falling
from
me
like
a
garment
and
I
move
towards
the
star
as
a
child
And
O
my
Father
now
I
thank
Thee
that
it
has
so
often
opened
to
receive
those
dear
ones
who
await
me
And
the
star
was
shining
and
it
shines
upon
his
grave

In

beaver
Illustration
They
are
very
timid
animals
If
we
went
to
places
where
they
are
common
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
find
them
and
see
what
they
do
The
beaver
is
between
two
and
three
feet
long
and
one
foot
high
and
is
covered
with
brown
hair
Its
eyes
are
very
small
and
far
apart
its
ears
also
are
small
and
its
nose
blunt
It
has
very
strong
sharp
teeth
and
a
long
tail
shaped
somewhat
like
the
blade
of
an
oar
This
tail
has
no
hair
or
fur
on
it
but
is
covered
with
little
scales
like
those
of
a
fish
The
hind
feet
of
the
beaver
have
a
thin
skin
between
the
toes
This
shows
that
the
beaver
is
fitted
for
swimming
During
the
summer
these
animals
live
in
holes
near
the
banks
of
rivers
They
are
very
social
animals
They
never
live
alone
They
usually
go
in
parties
and
build
a
little
beaver
town
They
have
some
means
of
making
known
their
wants
to
each
other
They
know
they
will
be
safer
in
water
than
on
land
so
they
try
to
find
a
pond
where
they
can
build
their
town
If
they
can
not
do
this
they
will
choose
a
running
stream
with
some
trees
on
the
banks
The
first
thing
they
do
is
to
make
a
dam
right
across
the
stream
They
have
neither
saws
nor
hatchets
with
which
to
cut
down
the
trees
but
they
use
their
sharp
strong
teeth
and
gnaw
and
gnaw
away
until
they
bring
down
tree
after
tree
These
little
wood
cutters
know
very
well
how
to
do
this
otherwise
the
trees
might
fall
and
kill
them
When
they
have
gnawed
nearly
through
the
trunk
away
they
run
to
see
if
the
tree
is
beginning
to
bend
If
it
is
still
straight
they
set
to
work
again
but
the
moment
they
hear
it
crack
off
they
run
to
keep
out
of
danger
When
the
tree
is
down
they
gnaw
off
all
the
branches
in
the
same
way
and
then
cut
the
trunk
into
short
pieces
and
roll
them
down
to
the
water
s
edge
Then
they
go
to
work
at
another
tree
and
still
another
until
they
have
cut
down
all
they
want
These
logs
of
wood
kept
in
their
places
by
mud
and
stones
make
a
dam
and
this
dam
stops
the
water
and
causes
it
to
rise
around
their
houses
and
cover
the
openings
which
are
at
the
bottom
and
helps
to
keep
them
safe
from
danger
Then
the
houses
are
built
of
mud
stones
sticks
and
small
branches
twined
in
and
out
to
keep
them
fast
These
houses
are
several
feet
high
and
are
very
thick
There
are
two
rooms
in
them
one
at
the
bottom
under
water
which
they
use
for
a
store
room
and
the
other
at
the
top
above
the
water
for
a
living
room
The
floor
of
this
room
is
covered
with
soft
moss
But
these
wise
beavers
know
that
they
must
have
a
store
of
food
for
the
winter
as
well
as
a
snug
little
house
to
live
in
They
gather
logs
of
wood
and
branches
and
put
them
away
in
their
store
room
The
bark
of
these
logs
and
some
water
plants
supply
them
with
food
When
they
are
at
home
during
the
winter
months
in
their
beaver
town
they
always
have
a
sentinel
to
keep
watch
and
if
any
one
comes
near
he
gives
the
alarm
by
striking
the
water
with
his
broad
flat
tail
There
are
no
idle
beavers
They
not
only
work
hard
but
with
great
skill
and
care

in
Ireland
that

LOVER
A
baby
was
sleeping
Its

was
weeping
For
her

was
far

And
the

Round

And
she
cried

And
smiled
in

Oh

XLII
A
NARROW
ESCAPE
In
Livingstone
the
celebrated
traveller
settled
as
a
missionary
in
Mabtosa
a
beautiful
valley
in
South
Africa
Here
he
met
with
an
adventure
which
nearly
terminated
his
earthly
career
The
natives
of
Mabtosa
had
long
been
troubled
by
lions
which
invaded
their
cattle
pens
by
night
and
even
attacked
the
herds
during
the
day
These
poor
people
being
very
ignorant
and
superstitious
thought
that
the
inroads
of
the
lions
were
caused
by
witchcraft
It
was
perhaps
for
this
reason
that
all
their
attempts
to
drive
away
the
animals
were
feeble
and
faint
hearted
and
therefore
unsuccessful
It
is
well
known
that
a
troop
of
lions
will
not
remain
long
in
any
district
where
one
of
their
number
has
been
killed
So
the
next
time
the
herds
of
Mabtosa
were
attacked
Livingstone
went
out
with
the
natives
to
encourage
them
to
destroy
one
of
the
marauders
and
thus
free
themselves
from
the
whole
troop
They
found
the
lions
on
a
small
hill
covered
with
wood
The
hunters
placed
themselves
in
a
circle
round
the
hill
and
began
to
ascend
coming
gradually
closer
to
each
other
as
they
approached
the
summit
Livingstone
remained
along
with
a
native
teacher
on
the
plain
below
to
watch
the
man
uvres
of
the
party
His
companion
seeing
one
of
the
lions
sitting
on
a
piece
of
rock
within
the
circle
of
hunters
took
aim
and
fired
but
the
ball
only
struck
the
stones
at
the
animal
s
feet
With
a
roar
of
rage
the
fierce
brute
bounded
away
broke
through
the
ring
and
escaped
unhurt
the
natives
not
having
the
courage
to
stand
close
and
spear
him
as
he
passed
The
band
again
closed
in
and
resumed
their
march
There
were
still
two
lions
in
the
wood
and
it
was
hoped
that
fortune
would
favor
a
second
attempt
to
destroy
one
of
them
But
suddenly
a
terrific
roar
echoed
from
the
hill
and
the
timid
hunters
quaked
with
fear
First
one
of
the
lions
and
then
the
other
with
streaming
manes
and
glaring
eyes
rushed
down
through
the
wavering
ranks
and
bounded
away
free
to
continue
their
devastations
As
the
party
were
returning
home
bewailing
their
want
of
success
Livingstone
observed
one
of
the
lions
about
thirty
yards
in
front
sitting
on
a
rock
behind
a
bush
Raising
his
gun
he
took
steady
aim
and
discharged
both
barrels
into
the
thicket
He
is
shot
He
is
shot
was
the
joyful
cry
and
some
of
the
men
were
about
to
rush
in
and
despatch
the
wounded
beast
with
their
spears
But
Livingstone
seeing
the
lion
s
tail
erected
in
anger
warned
them
to
keep
back
until
he
had
fired
a
second
time
He
was
just
in
the
act
of
reloading
when
hearing
a
shout
of
terror
he
looked
round
and
saw
the
lion
preparing
to
spring
It
was
too
late
to
retreat
With
a
savage
growl
the
frenzied
animal
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
and
shook
him
as
a
terrier
shakes
a
rat
The
shock
caused
a
momentary
anguish
followed
by
a
sort
of
drowsiness
in
which
he
had
no
sense
of
pain
nor
feeling
of
terror
though
he
knew
all
that
was
happening
Illustration
The
lion
s
paw
was
resting
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
as
he
turned
round
to
relieve
himself
of
the
pressure
he
saw
the
creature
s
fiery
eyes
directed
to
the
native
teacher
who
at
a
distance
of
ten
or
fifteen
yards
was
making
ready
to
shoot
The
gun
missed
fire
in
both
barrels
and
the
lion
sprang
at
his
new
assailant
and
bit
him
in
the
thigh
Another
man
also
who
was
standing
near
was
severely
bitten
in
the
shoulder
but
at
this
moment
the
bullets
took
effect
and
the
huge
beast
fell
back
dead
All
this
occurred
in
a
few
seconds
the
death
blow
had
been
inflicted
before
the
animal
sprang
upon
his
assailants
Livingstone
s
arm
was
wounded
in
eleven
places
and
the
bone
crushed
into
splinters
and
the
injuries
might
have
proved
fatal
but
for
his
tartan
jacket
which
wiped
the
poison
from
the
lion
s
teeth
before
they
entered
the
flesh
It
was
long
ere
the
wounds
healed
and
all
through
life
the
intrepid
missionary
bore
the
marks
of
this
dreadful
encounter
Thirty
years
afterwards
when
his
noble
and
useful
career
had
ended
among
the
swamps
of
Central
Africa
and
his
remains
were
taken
to
England
to
be
interred
in
Westminster
Abbey
the
crushed
and
mangled
arm
was
one
of
the
marks
which
enabled
his
sorrowing
friends
in
that
country
to
identify
the
body
as
that

And
where

I
ve

Midsummer
night

And
what
did
you
see

Mary
All
up
on
the
Caldon
Low
I
saw

blithe
sunshine
come

And
I
saw
the
merry
winds
blow
And
what
did
you
hear
my
Mary
All
up
on
the
Caldon
Hill
I
heard
the
drops
of
the
water
made
And
the
green
corn
ears
to
fill
Oh
tell
me
all
my
Mary
All
all
that
ever
you
know
For
you
must
have
seen
the
fairies
Last
night
on
the
Caldon
Low
Then
take
me
on
your

And
listen
mother
of

A
hundred
fairies
danced
last
night
And
the
harpers
they
were
nine
And
merry
was
the
glee
of
the
harp
strings
And
their
dancing
feet
so
small
But
oh
the
sound
of
their
talking
Was
merrier
far
than
all
And
what
were
the
words
my
Mary
That
you
did
hear
them
say
I
ll
tell
you
all
my
mother
But
let
me
have
my
way
And
some
they
played
with
the
water
And
rolled
it
down
the
hill
And
this
they
said
shall
speedily
turn
The
poor
old
miller
s
mill
For
there
has
been
no
water
Ever
since
the
first
of
May
And
a
busy
man
shall
the
miller
be
By
the
dawning
of
the
day
Oh
the
miller
how
he
will
laugh
When
he
sees
the
mill
dam
rise
The
jolly
old
miller
how
he
will
laugh
Till
the
tears
fill
both
his
eyes
And
some
they
seized
the
little
winds
That
sounded
over
the
hill
And
each
put
a
horn
into
his
mouth
And
blew
so
sharp
and
shrill
And
there
said
they
the
merry
winds
go
Away
from
every
horn
And
those
shall
clear
the
mildew
dank
From
the
blind
old
widow
s
corn
Oh
the
poor
blind
old
widow
Though
she
has
been
blind
so
long
She
ll
be
merry
enough
when
the
mildew
s
gone
And
the
corn
stands
stiff
and
strong
And
some
they
brought
the
brown
lintseed
And
flung
it
down
from
the
Low
And
this
said
they
by
the
sunrise
In
the
weaver
s
croft
shall
grow
Oh
the
poor
lame
weaver
How
he
will
laugh
outright
When
he
sees
his
dwindling
flax
field
All
full
of
flowers
by
night
And
then
upspoke
a
brownie
With
a
long
beard
on
his
chin
I
have
spun
up
all
the
tow
said
he
And
I
want
some
more
to
spin
I
ve
spun
a
piece
of
hempen
cloth
And
I
want
to
spin
another
A
little
sheet
for
Mary
s
bed
And
an
apron
for
her
mother
And
with
that
I
could
not
help
but
laugh
And
I
laughed
out
loud
and
free
And
then
on
the
top
of
the
Caldon
Low
There
was
no
one
left
but
me
And
all
on
the
top
of
the
Caldon
Low
The
mists
were
cold
and
gray
And
nothing
I
saw
but
the
mossy
stones
That
round
about
me
lay
But
as
I
came
down
from
the
hill
top
I
heard
afar
below
How
busy
the
jolly
miller
was
And
how
merry
the
wheel
did
go
And
I
peeped
into
the
widow
s
field
And
sure
enough
were
seen
The
yellow
ears
of
the
mildewed
corn
All
standing
stiff
and
green
And
down
by
the
weaver
s
croft
I
stole
To
see
if
the
flax
were
high
But
I
saw
the
weaver
at
his
gate
With
the
good
news
in
his
eye
Now
this
is
all
I
heard
mother
And
all
that
I
did
see
So
prithee
make
my
bed
mother
For
I
m
tired
as
I
can
be

VOLCANOES
Illustration
In
various
parts
of
the
earth
there
are
mountains
that
send
out
from
their
highest
peaks
smoke
ashes
and
fire
Mountains
of
this
class
are
called
volcanoes
and
they
present
a
striking
contrast
to
other
mountains
on
account
of
their
conical
form
and
the
character
of
the
rocks
of
which
they
are
composed
All
volcanoes
have
at
their
summits
what
are
called
craters
These
are
large
hollow
circular
openings
from
which
the
smoke
and
fire
escape
Nearly
all
volcanoes
emit
smoke
constantly
This
smoke
proceeds
from
fires
that
are
burning
far
down
in
the
depths
of
the
earth
Sometimes
these
fires
burst
forth
from
the
crater
of
the
volcano
with
tremendous
force
The
smoke
becomes
thick
and
black
and
lurid
flames
shoot
up
to
a
height
of
hundreds
of
feet
making
a
scene
of
amazing
grandeur
With
the
flames
there
are
thrown
out
stones
ashes
and
streams
of
melted
rock
called
lava
This
lava
flows
down
the
sides
of
the
mountain
and
being
red
hot
destroys
everything
with
which
it
comes
in
contact
At
such
times
a
volcano
is
said
to
be
in
eruption
Such
is
the
force
of
some
of
these
eruptions
that
large
rocks
have
been
hurled
to
great
distances
from
the
crater
and
towns
and
cities
have
been
buried
under
a
vast
covering
of
ashes
and
lava
The
quantity
of
lava
and
ashes
which
sometimes
escapes
from
volcanoes
during
an
eruption
is
almost
beyond
comprehension
In
a
volcano
in
the
island
of
Java
threw
out
ashes
and
cinders
that
covered
the
ground
fifty
feet
deep
for
a
distance
of
seven
miles
all
around
the
mountain
This
eruption
destroyed
nearly
forty
towns
and
villages
In
a
volcano
in
Iceland
sent
out
two
streams
of
lava
one
forty
miles
long
and
seven
miles
wide
and
the
other
fifty
miles
long
and
fifteen
miles
wide
These
streams
were
from
one
hundred
to
six
hundred
feet
deep
Near
the
city
of
Naples
in
Italy
is
situated
the
volcano
Mt
Vesuvius
This
fiery
monster
has
probably
caused
more
destruction
than
any
other
volcano
known
In
the
year
A
D
it
suddenly
burst
forth
in
a
violent
eruption
that
resulted
in
one
of
the
most
appalling
disasters
that
ever
happened
Such
immense
quantities
of
ashes
stones
and
lava
were
poured
forth
from
its
crater
that
within
twenty
hours
two
large
cities
were
completely
destroyed
These
cities
were
Herculaneum
and
Pompeii
At
this
eruption
of
Vesuvius
the
stream
of
lava
flowed
directly
through
and
over
the
city
of
Herculaneum
into
the
sea
The
quantity
was
so
great
that
as
it
cooled
and
became
hardened
it
gradually
filled
up
all
the
streets
and
ran
over
the
tops
of
the
houses
While
the
lava
was
thus
turning
the
city
into
a
mass
of
solid
stone
the
inhabitants
were
fleeing
from
it
along
the
shore
toward
Naples
and
in
boats
on
the
sea
At
the
same
time
too
the
wind
carried
the
ashes
and
cinders
in
such
a
direction
as
to
deluge
the
city
of
Pompeii
Slowly
and
steadily
the
immense
volume
of
ashes
and
small
stones
blocked
up
the
streets
and
settled
on
the
roofs
of
the
houses
The
light
of
the
flames
that
burst
out
from
the
awful
crater
aided
the
people
in
their
escape
but
many
who
for
some
reason
could
not
get
away
perished
Pompeii
was
so
completely
covered
that
nothing
could
be
seen
of
it
Thus
it
remained
buried
under
the
ground
until
the
year
when
it
was
discovered
by
accident
Since
that
time
much
of
the
city
has
been
uncovered
and
now
one
can
walk
along
the
streets
look
into
the
houses
and
form
some
idea
how
the
people
lived
there
eighteen
hundred
years
ago

XLVI
CURIOUS
BIRDS
NESTS
Among
the
most
curious
nests
are
those
made
by
the
birds
called
weavers
These
feathered
workmen
serve
no
apprenticeship
their
trade
comes
to
them
by
nature
and
how
well
they
work
at
it
But
then
you
must
admit
that
Nature
is
a
skilful
teacher
and
birds
are
apt
scholars
The
Baltimore
oriole
is
a
weaver
and
it
makes
its
nest
out
of
bark
fine
grass
moss
and
wool
strengthening
it
when
circumstances
permit
with
pieces
of
string
or
horsehair
This
nest
pouch
shaped
and
open
at
the
top
is
fastened
to
the
branch
of
a
tree
and
is
sometimes
interwoven
with
the
twigs
of
a
waving
bough
The
threads
of
grass
and
long
fibres
of
moss
are
woven
together
in
and
out
as
if
by
machinery
and
it
seems
hard
to
believe
that
the
little
birds
can
do
such
work
without
help
The
long
slender
boughs
of
the
willow
are
the
favorite
resort
of
the
oriole
and
here
in
the
midst
of
a
storm
the
bird
may
sit
in
its
swinging
nest
fearing
no
danger
What
is
there
to
dread
The
trees
rock
in
the
wind
but
the
oriole
s
habitation
is
strong
and
well
secured
Unless
the
branch
from
which
the
nest
hangs
be
torn
from
the
tree
the
nest
will
endure
the
tempest
and
prove
a
safe
shelter
for
the
blithe
little
bird
Many
weaver
birds
in
Asia
and
Africa
hang
their
nests
from
the
ends
of
twigs
and
branches
overhanging
the
water
This
is
to
keep
away
monkeys
and
snakes
which
abound
in
hot
countries
and
are
the
greatest
enemies
birds
have
The
wise
little
weaver
knows
that
the
cunning
monkey
will
not
trust
his
precious
life
to
a
frail
branch
that
may
break
and
drop
him
into
the
water
yet
the
same
frail
branch
is
strong
enough
for
the
bird
and
its
nest
In
this
case
the
monkey
is
obliged
to
admit
that
the
bird
s
wisdom
is
more
than
a
match
for
his
Illustration
A
very
curious
custom
exists
among
a
class
of
birds
found
in
Africa
called
the
social
weavers
They
begin
their
work
in
companies
and
build
immense
canopies
like
umbrellas
in
the
tops
of
trees
These
grassy
structures
are
so
closely
woven
that
the
rain
cannot
penetrate
them
Under
this
shelter
the
birds
build
their
nests
but
no
longer
in
company
the
nest
for
each
pair
must
be
made
by
the
pair
without
assistance
from
their
neighbors
The
tailor
bird
of
India
makes
a
still
more
curious
nest
than
that
of
the
weavers
it
actually
sews
using
its
long
slender
bill
as
a
needle
Birds
that
fly
birds
that
run
birds
that
swim
and
birds
that
sing
are
by
no
means
rare
but
birds
that
sew
seem
like
the
wonderful
birds
in
the
fairy
tales
Yet
they
really
exist
and
make
their
odd
nests
with
great
care
and
skill
They
pick
out
a
leaf
large
enough
for
their
nest
and
pierce
rows
of
holes
along
the
edges
with
their
sharp
bill
then
with
the
fibres
of
a
plant
or
long
threads
of
grass
they
sew
the
leaf
up
into
a
bag
Sometimes
it
is
necessary
to
sew
two
leaves
together
that
the
space
within
may
be
large
enough
This
kind
of
sewing
resembles
shoemakers
or
saddlers
work
but
the
leaf
being
like
fine
cloth
and
not
like
leather
perhaps
the
name
tailor
bird
is
the
most
appropriate
for
the
little
worker
The
bag
is
lined
with
soft
downy
material
and
in
this
the
tiny
eggs
are
laid
tiny
indeed
for
the
tailor
bird
is
no
larger
than
the
humming
bird
The
weight
of
the
little
creature
does
not
even
draw
down
the
nest
and
the
leaf
in
which
the
eggs
or
young
birds
are
hidden
looks
like
the
other
leaves
on
the
trees
so
that
there
is
nothing
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
forest
robbers
Another
bird
called
the
Indian
sparrow
makes
her
nest
of
grass
woven
like
cloth
and
shaped
like
a
bottle
The
neck
of
the
bottle
hangs
downward
and
the
bird
enters
from
below
This
structure
swinging
from
a
high
tree
over
a
river
is
safe
from
the
visits
of
mischievous
animals
If
all
the
stories
about
this
Indian
sparrow
are
true
the
inside
of
its
nest
is
strangely
adorned
Fire
flies
are
brought
in
by
the
bird
and
stuck
to
the
walls
with
clay
whether
they
are
placed
there
to
light
up
the
little
home
or
to
dazzle
the
bats
that
infest
the
neighborhood
no
one
seems
to
know
Perhaps
the
truth
is
that
the
fire
flies
are
in
the
nest
in
imagination
only
However
that
may
be
the
Indian
sparrow
is
a
clever
workman
Can
you
wonder
that
birds
and
their
nests
have
always
been
a
source
of
delight
to
the
thoughtful
enquirer
Mark

XLIX
THE
WHISTLE
BENJAMIN
FRANKLIN
When
I
was
a
child
seven
years
old
my
friends
on
a
holiday
filled
my
pockets
with
coppers
I
went
directly
toward
a
shop
where
they
sold
toys
for
children
and
being
charmed
with
the
sound
of
a
whistle
that
I
met
by
the
way
in
the
hands
of
another
boy
I
voluntarily
offered
him
all
my
money
for
it
I
then
returned
home
and
went
whistling
all
over
the
house
much
pleased
with
my
whistle
but
disturbing
all
the
family
My
brothers
and
sisters
and
cousins
understanding
the
bargain
I
had
made
told
me
I
had
given
four
times
as
much
for
it
as
it
was
worth
This
put
me
in
mind
of
what
good
things
I
might
have
bought
with
the
rest
of
the
money
and
they
laughed
at
me
so
much
for
my
folly
that
I
cried
with
vexation
This
however
was
afterward
of
use
to
me
the
impression
continuing
on
my
mind
so
that
often
when
I
was
tempted
to
buy
some
unnecessary
thing
I
said
to
myself
Don
t
give
too
much
for
the
whistle
and
so
I
saved
my
money
As
I
grew
up
went
into
the
world
and
observed
the
actions
of
men
I
thought
I
met
with
many
very
many
who
gave
too
much
for
their
whistles
When
I
saw
any
one
too
ambitious
of
the
favor
of
the
great
wasting
his
time
in
attendance
on
public
dinners
sacrificing
his
repose
his
liberty
his
virtue
and
perhaps
his
friends
to
retain
it
I
said
to
myself
This
man
gives
too
much
for
his
whistle
When
I
saw
another
fond
of
popularity
constantly
employing
himself
in
politics
neglecting
his
own
affairs
and
ruining
them
by
that
neglect
He
pays
indeed
said
I
too
much
for
his
whistle
If
I
knew
a
miser
who
gave
up
every
kind
of
comfortable
living
all
the
pleasure
of
doing
good
to
others
all
the
esteem
of
his
fellow
citizens
and
the
joys
of
benevolent
friendship
for
the
sake
of
accumulating
wealth
Poor
man
said
I
you
do
indeed
pay
too
much
for
your
whistle
When
I
met
a
man
of
pleasure
sacrificing
the
improvement
of
his
mind
or
of
his
fortune
to
mere
bodily
comfort
Mistaken
man
said
I
you
are
providing
pain
for
yourself
instead
of
pleasure
you
give
too
much
for
your
whistle
If
I
saw
one
fond
of
fine
clothes
fine
furniture
fine
horses
all
above
his
fortune
for
which
he
contracted
debts
and
ended
his
career
in
prison
Alas
said
I
he
has
paid
dear
very
dear
for
his
whistle
In
short
I
believed
that
a
great
part
of
the
miseries
of
mankind
were
brought
upon
them
by
the
false
estimates
they
had
made
of
the
value
of
things
and
by
their
giving
too
much
for
their
whistles

no
motion
Her
keel
was
steady
in
the
ocean
Without
either
sign
or
sound
of
their
shock
The
waves
flowed
over
the
Inchcape
Rock
So
little
they
rose
so
little
they
fell
They
did
not
move
the
Inchcape
Bell
The
pious
Abbot
of
Aberbrothock
Had
placed
that
bell
on
the
Inchcape
Rock
On
a
buoy
in
the
storm
it
floated
and
swung
And
over
the
waves
its
warning
rung
When
the
Rock
was
hid
by
the
surge
s
swell
The
mariners
heard
the
warning
bell
And
then
they
knew
the
perilous
Rock
And
blessed
the
Abbot
of
Aberbrothock
The
sun
in
heaven
was
shining
gay
All
things
were
joyful
on
that
day
The
sea
birds
screamed
as
they
wheeled
round
And
there
was
joyance
in
their
sound
The
buoy
of
the
Inchcape
Bell
was
seen
A
darker
speck
on
the
ocean
green
Sir
Ralph
the
Rover
walked
his
deck
And
he
fixed
his
eye
on
the
darker
speck
He
felt
the
cheering
power
of
spring
It
made
him
whistle
it
made
him
sing
His
heart
was
mirthful
to
excess
But
the
Rover
s
mirth
was
wickedness
His
eye
was
on
the
Inchcape
float
Quoth
he
My
men
put
out
the
boat
And
row
me
to
the
Inchcape
Rock
And
I
ll
plague
the
Abbot
of
Aberbrothock
The
boat
is
lowered
the
boatmen
row
And
to
the
Inchcape
Rock
they
go
Sir
Ralph
bent
over
from
the
boat
And
he
cut
the
bell
from
the
Inchcape
float
Down
sank
the
bell
with
a
gurgling
sound
The
bubbles
rose
and
burst
around
Quoth
Sir
Ralph
The
next
who
comes
to
the
Rock
Won
t
bless
the
Abbot
of
Aberbrothock
Sir
Ralph
the
Rover
sailed
away
He
scoured
the
seas
for
many
a
day
And
now
grown
rich
with
plundered
store
He
steers
his
course
for
Scotland
s
shore
So
thick
a
haze
o
erspreads
the
sky
They
cannot
see
the
sun
on
high
The
wind
hath
blown
a
gale
all
day
At
evening
it
hath
died
away
On
the
deck
the
Rover
takes
his
stand
So
dark
it
is
they
see
no
land
Quoth
Sir
Ralph
It
will
be
lighter
soon
For
there
is
the
dawn
of
the
rising
moon
Canst
hear
said
one
the
breakers
roar
For
methinks
we
should
be
near
the
shore
Now
where
we
are
I
cannot
tell
But
I
wish
we
could
hear
the
Inchcape
Bell
They
hear
no
sound
the
swell
is
strong
Though
the
wind
hath
fallen
they
drift
along
Till
the
vessel
strikes
with
a
shivering
shock
Cried
they
It
is
the
Inchcape
Rock
Sir
Ralph
the
Rover
tore
his
hair
He
cursed
himself
in
his
despair
The
waves
rush
in
on
every
side
The
ship
is
sinking
beneath
the
tide
But
even
in
his
dying
fear
One
dreadful
sound
could
the
Rover
hear
A
sound
as
if
with
the
Inchcape
Bell
The
fiends
below
were
ringing
his
knell
LII
THE
FLAX
HANS
CHRISTIAN
ANDERSEN
The
flax
was
in
full
bloom
it
had
pretty
little
blue
flowers
as
delicate
as
the
wings
of
a
moth
or
even
more
so
The
sun
shone
and
the
showers
watered
it
and
this
was
just
as
good
for
the
flax
as
it
is
for
little
children
to
be
washed
and
then
kissed
by
their
mother
They
look
much
prettier
for
it
and
so
did
the
flax
People
say
that
I
look
exceedingly
well
said
the
flax
and
that
I
am
so
fine
and
long
that
I
shall
make
a
beautiful
piece
of
linen
How
fortunate
I
am
it
makes
me
so
happy
it
is
such
a
pleasant
thing
to
know
that
something
can
be
made
of
me
How
the
sunshine
cheers
me
and
how
sweet
and
refreshing
is
the
rain
my
happiness
overpowers
me
no
one
in
the
world
can
feel
happier
than
I
do
One
day
some
people
came
who
took
hold
of
the
flax
and
pulled
it
up
by
the
roots
this
was
painful
Then
it
was
laid
in
water
as
if
they
intended
to
drown
it
and
after
that
placed
near
a
fire
as
if
it
were
to
be
roasted
all
this
was
very
shocking
We
cannot
expect
to
be
happy
always
said
the
flax
by
experiencing
evil
as
well
as
good
we
become
wise
And
certainly
there
was
plenty
of
evil
in
store
for
the
flax
It
was
steeped
and
roasted
and
broken
and
combed
indeed
it
scarcely
knew
what
was
done
to
it
At
last
it
was
put
on
the
spinning
wheel
Whirr
whirr
went
the
wheel
so
quickly
that
the
flax
could
not
collect
its
thoughts
Well
I
have
been
very
happy
he
thought
in
the
midst
of
his
pain
and
must
be
contented
with
the
past
and
contented
he
remained
till
he
was
put
on
the
loom
and
became
a
beautiful
piece
of
white
linen
All
the
flax
even
to
the
last
stalk
was
used
in
making
this
one
piece
How
wonderful
it
is
that
after
all
I
have
suffered
I
am
made
something
of
at
last
I
am
the
luckiest
person
in
the
world
so
strong
and
fine
and
how
white
and
what
a
length
This
is
something
different
from
being
a
mere
plant
and
bearing
flowers
Then
I
had
no
attention
nor
any
water
unless
it
rained
Now
I
am
watched
and
taken
care
of
Every
morning
the
maid
turns
me
over
and
I
have
a
shower
bath
from
the
watering
pot
every
evening
Yes
and
the
clergyman
s
wife
noticed
me
and
said
I
was
the
best
piece
of
linen
in
the
whole
parish
I
cannot
be
happier
than
I
am
now
After
some
time
the
linen
was
taken
into
the
house
placed
under
the
scissors
and
cut
and
torn
into
pieces
and
then
pricked
with
needles
This
certainly
was
not
pleasant
but
at
last
it
was
made
into
garments
See
now
then
said
the
flax
I
have
become
something
of
importance
This
was
my
destiny
it
is
quite
a
blessing
Now
I
shall
be
of
some
use
in
the
world
as
every
one
ought
to
be
it
is
the
only
way
to
be
happy
Years
passed
away
and
at
last
the
linen
was
so
worn
it
could
scarcely
hold
together
It
must
end
very
soon
said
the
pieces
to
each
other
We
would
gladly
have
held
together
a
little
longer
but
it
is
useless
to
expect
impossibilities
And
at
length
they
fell
into
rags
and
tatters
and
thought
it
was
all
over
with
them
for
they
were
torn
to
shreds
and
steeped
in
water
and
made
into
a
pulp
and
dried
and
they
knew
not
what
besides
till
all
at
once
they
found
themselves
beautiful
white
paper
Well
now
this
is
a
surprise
a
glorious
surprise
too
said
the
paper
I
am
now
finer
than
ever
and
I
shall
be
written
upon
and
who
can
tell
what
fine
things
I
may
have
written
upon
me
This
is
wonderful
luck
And
sure
enough
the
most
beautiful
stories
and
poetry
were
written
upon
it
and
only
once
was
there
a
blot
which
was
very
fortunate
Then
people
heard
the
stories
and
poetry
read
and
it
made
them
wiser
and
better
for
all
that
was
written
had
a
good
and
sensible
meaning
and
a
great
blessing
was
contained
in
the
words
on
the
paper
I
never
imagined
anything
like
this
said
the
paper
when
I
was
only
a
little
blue
flower
growing
in
the
fields
How
could
I
fancy
that
I
should
ever
be
the
means
of
bringing
knowledge
and
joy
to
men
I
cannot
understand
it
myself
and
yet
it
is
really
so
Heaven
knows
that
I
have
done
nothing
myself
but
what
I
was
obliged
to
do
with
my
weak
powers
for
my
own
preservation
and
yet
I
have
been
promoted
from
one
joy
and
honor
to
another
Each
time
I
think
that
the
song
is
ended
and
then
something
higher
and
better
begins
for
me
I
suppose
now
I
shall
be
sent
on
my
travels
about
the
world
so
that
people
may
read
me
It
cannot
be
otherwise
indeed
it
is
more
than
probable
for
I
have
more
splendid
thoughts
written
upon
me
than
I
had
pretty
flowers
in
olden
times
I
am
happier
than
ever
But
the
paper
did
not
go
on
its
travels
It
was
sent
to
the
printer
and
all
the
words
written
upon
it
were
set
up
in
type
to
make
a
book
or
rather
hundreds
of
books
for
so
many
more
persons
could
derive
pleasure
and
profit
from
a
printed
book
than
from
the
written
paper
and
if
the
paper
had
been
sent
about
the
world
it
would
have
been
worn
out
before
it
had
got
half
through
its
journey
This
is
certainly
the
wisest
plan
said
the
written
paper
I
really
did
not
think
of
that
I
shall
remain
at
home
and
be
held
in
honor
like
some
old
grandfather
as
I
really
am
to
all
these
new
books
They
will
do
some
good
I
could
not
have
wandered
about
as
they
do
Yet
he
who
wrote
all
this
has
looked
at
me
as
every
word
flowed
from
his
pen
upon
my
surface
I
am
the
most
honored
of
all
Then
the
paper
was
tied
in
a
bundle
with
other
papers
and
thrown
into
a
tub
that
stood
in
the
washhouse
After
work
it
is
well
to
rest
said
the
paper
and
a
very
good
opportunity
this
is
to
collect
one
s
thoughts
Now
I
am
able
for
the
first
time
to
think
of
my
real
condition
and
to
know
one
s
self
is
true
progress
What
will
be
done
with
me
now
I
wonder
No
doubt
I
shall
still
go
forward
Now
it
happened
one
day
that
all
the
paper
in
the
tub
was
taken
out
and
laid
on
the
hearth
to
be
burnt
People
said
it
could
not
be
sold
at
the
shop
to
wrap
up
butter
and
sugar
because
it
had
been
written
upon
The
children
in
the
house
stood
round
the
stove
for
they
wanted
to
see
the
paper
burn
because
it
flamed
up
so
prettily
and
afterwards
among
the
ashes
so
many
red
sparks
could
be
seen
running
one
after
the
other
here
and
there
as
quick
as
the
wind
They
called
it
seeing
the
children
come
out
of
school
and
the
last
spark
was
the
schoolmaster
They
often
thought
the
last
spark
had
come
and
one
would
cry
There
goes
the
schoolmaster
but
the
next
moment
another
spark
would
appear
shining
so
beautifully
How
they
would
like
to
know
where
the
sparks
all
went
to
Perhaps
we
shall
find
out
some
day
but
we
don
t
know
now
The
whole
bundle
of
paper
had
been
placed
on
the
fire
and
was
soon
alight
Ugh
cried
the
paper
as
it
burst
into
a
bright
flame
ugh
It
was
certainly
not
very
pleasant
to
be
burning
but
when
the
whole
was
wrapped
in
flames
the
flames
mounted
up
into
the
air
higher
than
the
flax
had
ever
been
able
to
raise
its
little
blue
flower
and
they
glistened
as
the
white
linen
never
could
have
glistened
All
the
written
letters
became
quite
red
in
a
moment
and
all
the
words
and
thoughts
turned
into
fire
Now
I
am
mounting
straight
up
to
the
sun
said
a
voice
in
the
flames
and
it
was
as
if
a
thousand
voices
echoed
the
words
and
the
flames
darted
up
through
the
chimney
and
went
out
at
the
top
Then
a
number
of
tiny
beings
as
many
in
number
as
the
flowers
on
the
flax
had
been
and
invisible
to
mortal
eyes
floated
above
them
They
were
even
lighter
and
more
delicate
than
the
flowers
from
which
they
were
born
and
as
the
flames
were
extinguished
and
nothing
remained
of
the
paper
but
black
ashes
these
little
things
danced
upon
it
and
whenever
they
touched
it
bright
red
sparks
appeared

Legs

Until

The

Softened

A

LIV
EGYPT
AND
ITS
RUINS
Illustration
Egypt
embraces
that
part
of
Africa
occupied
by
the
valley
of
the
River
Nile
For
many
centuries
it
was
a
thickly
populated
country
and
at
one
time
possessed
great
influence
and
wealth
and
had
reached
an
advanced
state
of
civilization
The
history
of
Egypt
extends
through
a
period
of
about
six
thousand
years
During
this
time
great
cities
were
built
which
flourished
for
hundreds
of
years
Owing
to
wars
and
changes
of
government
many
of
these
cities
were
destroyed
and
nothing
of
them
now
remains
but
massive
and
extensive
ruins
Pyramids
were
built
obelisks
erected
canals
projected
and
many
other
vast
enterprises
were
carried
out
Remains
of
these
are
to
be
seen
to
day
some
in
ruins
some
fairly
preserved
and
altogether
they
give
the
present
generation
an
idea
of
the
wealth
and
power
of
the
different
dynasties
under
which
they
were
built
Not
far
from
Cairo
which
is
now
the
principal
city
of
Egypt
stand
the
famous
pyramids
These
are
of
such
immense
proportions
that
from
a
distance
their
tops
seem
to
reach
the
clouds
They
are
constructed
of
great
blocks
of
stone
Some
of
these
are
of
great
size
and
how
the
builders
put
them
into
their
places
is
a
question
we
cannot
answer
It
is
supposed
that
the
construction
of
the
largest
pyramid
required
the
labor
of
thousands
of
men
for
more
than
twenty
years
It
is
four
hundred
and
sixty
one
feet
high
seven
hundred
and
forty
six
feet
long
at
the
base
and
covers
more
than
twelve
acres
of
ground
Sixty
seven
of
these
pyramids
in
all
have
been
discovered
and
explored
They
are
the
tombs
in
which
the
kings
of
ancient
Egypt
and
their
families
were
buried
To
contain
their
coffins
which
were
made
of
stone
many
chambers
were
constructed
in
the
interior
of
the
pyramids
It
has
been
calculated
that
one
of
the
principal
pyramids
could
contain
three
thousand
seven
hundred
rooms
of
large
size
The
bodies
of
those
who
were
buried
in
the
pyramids
were
preserved
from
decay
by
a
secret
process
which
we
call
embalming
and
which
was
known
only
to
the
priests
After
the
bodies
were
embalmed
they
were
wrapped
in
bands
of
fine
linen
and
on
the
inside
of
these
was
spread
a
peculiar
kind
of
gum
Sometimes
as
many
as
a
thousand
yards
of
these
bands
were
wrapped
around
a
single
body
After
the
bandaged
body
was
thus
prepared
a
soft
substance
was
placed
around
it
When
this
covering
hardened
it
kept
the
body
in
a
state
of
complete
preservation
These
coverings
are
now
called
mummy
cases
and
the
bodies
they
enclose
are
called
mummies
The
bodies
were
finally
placed
in
huge
stone
coffins
many
of
which
were
covered
with
curious
carvings
Some
mummies
have
been
found
that
are
said
to
be
over
three
thousand
years
old
But
notwithstanding
this
great
age
when
the
wrappings
are
removed
from
them
many
of
the
bodies
have
been
so
well
preserved
that
the
features
present
the
appearance
which
they
had
in
life
Large
numbers
of
mummies
have
been
carried
off
to
other
countries
and
placed
on
exhibition
in
museums
The
ancient
Egyptians
erected
many
obelisks
in
various
parts
of
their
country
These
were
monuments
made
from
single
pieces
of
hard
stone
and
in
some
cases
they
reached
a
height
of
more
than
a
hundred
feet
They
were
placed
before
gateways
leading
to
the
principal
temples
and
palaces
and
were
covered
with
curious
carvings
which
represented
the
language
of
the
people
at
that
time
Their
written
language
was
not
composed
of
letters
and
words
like
our
own
but
they
used
pictures
of
animals
including
birds
and
also
pictures
of
human
figures
and
other
devices
of
a
similar
nature
to
express
their
thoughts
and
ideas
These
pictures
are
now
called
hieroglyphics
Until
the
year
scholars
of
modern
nations
were
unable
to
read
this
strange
language
In
that
year
however
a
stone
tablet
was
discovered
by
a
French
engineer
containing
an
inscription
written
in
three
different
characters
namely
first
in
the
hieroglyphics
spoken
of
above
second
in
a
running
hand
also
used
by
the
Egyptians
and
third
in
the
well
known
letters
of
the
Greek
alphabet
By
comparing
the
words
of
these
inscriptions
with
many
others
the
proper
method
of
interpreting
this
peculiar
language
was
ascertained
It
was
then
learned
that
the
inscriptions
on
these
obelisks
were
the
records
of
memorable
events
and
of
the
heroic
deeds
of
ancient
kings
and
heroes
Many
of
the
obelisks
have
been
taken
from
their
positions
in
Egypt
and
transported
with
great
labor
to
other
countries
Nearly
two
thousand
years
ago
the
Roman
Emperors
began
to
carry
them
to
Rome
where
they
were
set
up
in
the
public
squares
Altogether
nearly
fifty
of
these
remarkable
monuments
were
taken
away
and
set
up
in
that
city
They
were
then
and
are
still
regarded
as
evidences
of
the
wonderful
ingenuity
and
skill
of
the
ancients
who
first
made
them
In
late
years
obelisks
have
been
taken
to
Paris
and
London
and
more
recently
one
has
been
brought
to
America
and
set
up
in
Central
Park
in
New
York
City
This
one
belongs
to
the
largest
class
being
nearly
seventy
feet
high
and
about
eight
feet
square
at
the
base
In
their
large
cities
the
Egyptians
built
massive
temples
which
were
dedicated
to
religious
ceremonies
Some
of
them
although
now
in
ruins
are
considered
to
be
among
the
most
remarkable
productions
of
the
ancients
Tourists
who
nowadays
sail
up
the
River
Nile
and
visit
the
site
of
the
city
of
Thebes
the
ancient
capital
of
Egypt
are
struck
with
amazement
at
the
vast
ruins
surrounding
them
On
the
eastern
side
of
the
Nile
lies
what
is
left
of
the
temple
of
Karnak
Imagine
a
long
line
of
courts
gateways
and
halls
with
here
and
there
an
obelisk
rising
above
the
ruins
and
shutting
off
the
view
of
the
forest
of
columns
The
temple
is
approached
on
every
side
by
avenues
and
gateways
of
colossal
grandeur
It
originally
covered
an
area
of
two
hundred
and
seventy
acres
enclosed
within
a
wall
of
brick
parts
of
which
are
still
visible
while
the
rest
lie
crumbled
and
broken
It
is
difficult
to
realize
the
grand
appearance
of
the
thirty
rows
of
stone
columns
standing
within
the
wall
Some
of
those
that
are
still
perfect
are
capped
with
enormous
monolith
capitals
and
it
is
said
that
on
one
of
them
a
hundred
men
could
stand
without
crowding
The
hall
itself
is
four
hundred
and
twenty
two
feet
long
by
one
hundred
and
sixty
five
feet
broad
The
stones
of
the
ceiling
are
supported
by
one
hundred
and
thirty
four
columns
The
largest
measures
ten
feet
in
diameter
and
more
than
seventy
two
feet
in
height
They
are
covered
with
carvings
and
paintings
whose
colors
are
still
bright
even
after
a
lapse
of
forty
centuries
Gazing
on
what
he
sees
around
him
the
traveller
becomes
lost
in
the
effort
to
form
some
idea
of
the
grandeur
and
vastness
of

ZLOBANE
MRS
GUSTAFSON
Zlobane
is
the
name
of
the
mountain
which
was
taken
by
storm
from
the
Zulus
by
the
British
forces
on
the
morning
of
the
th
of
March
On
the
top
of
this
mountain
the
victorious
English
troops
who
had
unsaddled
their
horses
and
cast
themselves
down
to
rest
were
surprised
and
surrounded
by
the
Zulus
Of
the
British
corps
only
one
captain
and
six
men
escaped
The
young
hero
of
the
ballad
was
the
son
of
Colonel
Weatherly
As
swayeth
in
the
summer
wind
The
close
and
stalwart
grain
So
moved
the
serried
Zulu
shields
That
day
on
wild
Zlobane
The
white
shield
of
the
husband
Who
hath
twice
need
of
life
The
black
shield
of
the
young
chief
Who
hath
not
yet
a
wife
Unrecking
harm
the
British
lay
Secure
as
if
they
slept
While
close
on
front
and
either
flank
The
live
black
crescent
crept
Then
burst
their
wild
and
frightful
cry
Upon
the
British
ears
With
whirr
of
bullets
glare
of
shields
And
flash
of
Zulu
spears
Uprose
the
British
in
the
shock
Reeled
but
an
instant
then
Shoulder
to
shoulder
faced
the
foe
And
met
their
doom
like
men
But
one
was
there
whose
heart
was
torn
In
a
more
awful
strife
He
had
the
soldier
s
steady
nerve
And
calm
disdain
of
life
Yet
now
half
turning
from
the
fray
Knee
smiting
against
knee
He
scanned
the
hills
if
yet
were
left
An
open
way
to
flee
Not
for
himself
His
little
son
Scarce
thirteen
summers
born
With
hair
that
shone
upon
his
brows
Like
tassels
of
the
corn
And
lips
yet
curled
in
that
sweet
pout
Shaped
by
the
mother
s
breast
Stood
by
his
side
and
silently
To
his
brave
father
pressed
The
horse
stood
nigh
the
father
kissed
And
tossed
the
boy
astride
Farewell
he
cried
and
for
thy
life
That
way
my
darling
ride
Scarce
touched
the
saddle
ere
the
boy
Leaped
lightly
to
the
ground
And
smote
the
horse
upon
its
flank
That
with
a
quivering
bound
It
sprang
and
galloped
for
the
hills
With
one
sonorous
neigh
The
fire
flashed
where
its
spurning
feet
Clanged
o
er
the
stony
way
Father
I
ll
die
with
you
The
sire
As
this
he
saw
and
heard
Turned
and
stood
breathless
in
the
joy
And
pang
that
knows
no
word
Once
each
as
do
long
knitted
friends
Upon
the
other
smiled
And
then
he
had
but
time
to
give
A

Ere

The

LVII
THE
RUBY
THROATED
HUMMING
BIRD
AUDUBON
The
most
common
as
well
as
the
most
beautiful
species
of
humming
birds
is
the
ruby
throat
a
name
given
to
it
on
account
of
the
delicate
metallic
feathers
which
glow
with
ruby
lustre
on
its
throat
gleaming
in
the
sunshine
like
gems
of
living
fire
From
the
tip
of
the
bill
to
that
of
the
tail
it
measures
about
three
and
a
half
inches
The
upper
part
of
the
neck
the
back
and
the
wing
coverts
are
of
a
resplendent
and
varied
green
and
gold
The
breast
and
lower
parts
are
white
the
wings
purplish
brown
and
the
tail
partly
of
the
same
color
with
the
two
middle
tail
feathers
of
vivid
green
In
the
warm
climate
of
the
Southern
States
the
beautiful
little
ruby
throat
is
found
throughout
the
winter
and
as
the
summer
draws
on
the
heat
in
the
Northern
States
and
Canada
suiting
its
delicate
constitution
it
migrates
in
large
numbers
appearing
in
Canada
towards
the
end
of
June
The
long
flights
of
these
tiny
creatures
are
performed
at
night
it
is
supposed
as
they
are
found
feeding
leisurely
at
all
times
of
the
day
When
passing
through
the
air
they
move
at
a
rapid
rate
in
long
undulations
now
rising
for
some
distance
at
an
angle
of
about
forty
degrees
then
falling
in
a
curve
Small
as
they
are
from
their
rapid
flight
and
meteor
like
movements
they
do
not
fear
the
largest
birds
of
prey
for
even
should
the
lordly
eagle
venture
into
their
domains
the
tiny
creature
will
attack
him
without
fear
and
one
has
been
seen
perched
on
the
head
of
an
eagle
at
which
it
was
pecking
away
furiously
scattering
the
feathers
of
the
huge
bird
who
flew
screaming
through
the
air
with
alarm
to
rid
himself
of
his
tiny
assailant
Brave
and
high
spirited
as
is
the
little
bird
it
is
easily
tamed
and
Mr
Webber
the
naturalist
succeeded
in
securing
several
specimens
The
first
he
caught
did
not
flutter
or
make
the
least
attempt
to
escape
but
remained
quietly
in
his
hand
and
he
saw
when
he
opened
it
the
minute
creature
lying
on
his
palm
perfectly
motionless
feigning
most
skilfully
to
be
dead
As
he
watched
it
with
breathless
curiosity
he
saw
it
slowly
open
its
bright
little
eyes
to
see
whether
the
way
was
clear
and
then
close
them
slowly
as
it
caught
his
glance
upon
it
When
a
mixture
of
sugar
water
and
honey
was
brought
and
a
drop
placed
on
its
bill
it
came
very
suddenly
to
life
and
in
a
moment
was
on
its
legs
drinking
with
eager
gusto
of
the
refreshing
draught
from
a
silver
teaspoon
The
nest
of
the
ruby
throat
is
of
a
most
delicate
nature
the
external
parts
being
formed
of
bits
of
a
little
grey
lichen
found
on
the
branches
of
trees
glued
together
by
the
saliva
of
the
bird
Bits
of
lichen
are
also
neatly
arranged
round
the
whole
of
the
nest
and
to
some
distance
from
the
spot
where
the
nest
is
attached
to
the
tree
The
interior
is
formed
of
a
cottony
substance
and
is
lined
with
silky
fibres
obtained
from
various
plants
The
difficulty
of
finding
the
little
nests
of
the
humming
birds
is
increased
by
a
curious
habit
possessed
by
some
of
the
species
When
they
leave
or
approach
their
home
they
do
so
as
if
conscious
that
by
the
bright
gleam
of
their
plumage
they
may
give
an
indication
of
the
place
of
their
nest
Rising
perpendicularly
until
they
are
out
of
sight
and
then
flying
to
the
point
under
which
their
nest
is
placed
they
drop
down
upon
it
as
perpendicularly
as
they
ascended
The
eggs
are
only
two
in
number
and
although
somewhat
larger
than
might
be
imagined
from
the
size
of
the
bird
are
very
small
indeed
They
are
of
a
delicate
slightly
pink
semi
transparent
white
color
and
have
been
well
compared
to
pearls
Could
you
cast
a
momentary
glance
on
the
nest
of
a
humming
bird
and
see
as
I
have
seen
the
newly
hatched
pair
of
young
not
much
larger
than
humble
bees
naked
blind
and
so
feeble
as
scarcely
to
be
able
to
raise
their
little
bills
to
receive
food
from
their
parents
and
could
you
see
those
parents
full
of
anxiety
and
fear
passing
and
repassing
within
a
few
inches
of
your
face
alighting
on
a
twig
not
more
than
a
yard
from
you
and
waiting
the
result
of
your
unwelcome
visit
in
a
state
of
despair
you
could
not
fail
to
be
interested
in
such
a
display
of
parental
affection
Then
how
pleasing
it
is
on
leaving
the
spot
to
see
the
returning
joy
of
the
parents
when
after
examining
the
nest
they
find
their
nurslings
untouched

on
his
forehead
lay
Somebody
clung
to
his
parting
hand
Somebody
s
waiting
and
watching
for
him
Yearning
to
hold
him
again
to
the
heart
And
there
he
lies
with
his
blue
eyes
dim
And
the
smiling
childlike
lips
apart
Tenderly
bury
the
fair
young
dead
Pausing
to
drop
on
his
grave
a
tear
Carve
on
the
wooden
slab
at
his
head
Somebody
s
darling
slumbers
here

SONG
FROM
THE
PRINCESS
TENNYSON
Home
they
brought
her
warrior
dead
She
nor
swooned
nor
uttered
cry
All
her
maidens
watching
said
She
must
weep
or
she
will
die
Then
they
praised
him
soft
and
low
Called
him
worthy
to
be
loved
Truest
friend
and
noblest
foe
Yet
she
neither
spoke
nor
moved
Stole
a
maiden
from
her
place
Lightly
to
the
warrior
stept
Took
the
face
cloth
from
the
face
Yet
she
neither
moved
nor
wept
Rose
a
nurse
of
ninety
years
Set
his
child
upon
her
knee
Like
summer
tempest
came
her
tears
Sweet
my
child
I
live
for
thee
LXI
ANTS
AND
THEIR
SLAVES
MICHELET
Peter
Huber
the
son
of
the
celebrated
observer
of
the
manners
and
habits
of
bees
walking
one
day
in
a
field
near
Geneva
saw
on
the
ground
a
strong
detachment
of
reddish
colored
ants
on
the
march
and
bethought
himself
of
following
them
On
the
flanks
of
the
column
as
if
to
dress
its
ranks
a
few
sped
to
and
fro
in
eager
haste
After
marching
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
halted
before
an
ant
hill
belonging
to
some
small
black
ants
and
a
desperate
struggle
took
place
at
its
gates
A
small
number
of
blacks
offered
a
brave
resistance
but
the
great
majority
of
the
people
thus
assailed
fled
through
the
gates
remotest
from
the
scene
of
combat
carrying
away
their
young
It
was
just
these
which
were
the
cause
of
the
strife
what
the
blacks
most
feared
being
the
theft
of
their
offspring
And
soon
the
assailants
who
had
succeeded
in
penetrating
into
the
city
might
be
seen
emerging
from
it
loaded
with
the
young
black
progeny
The
red
ants
encumbered
with
their
living
booty
left
the
unfortunate
city
in
the
desolation
of
its
great
loss
and
resumed
the
road
to
their
own
habitation
whither
their
astonished
and
almost
breathless
observer
followed
them
But
how
was
his
astonishment
augmented
when
at
the
threshold
of
the
red
ants
community
a
small
population
of
black
ants
came
forward
to
receive
the
plunder
welcoming
with
visible
joy
these
children
of
their
own
race
which
would
perpetuate
it
in
the
foreign
lands
This
then
is
a
mixed
city
where
the
strong
warrior
ants
live
on
a
perfectly
good
understanding
with
the
little
blacks
But
what
of
the
latter
Huber
speedily
discovered
that
in
fact
they
do
everything
They
alone
build
they
alone
bring
up
the
young
red
ants
and
the
captives
of
their
own
species
they
alone
administer
the
affairs
of
the
community
provide
its
supplies
of
food
and
wait
upon
and
feed
their
red
masters
who
like
great
infant
giants
indolently
allow
their
little
attendants
to
feed
them
at
the
mouth
No
other
occupations
are
theirs
but
war
theft
and
kidnapping
No
other
movements
in
the
intervals
than
to
wander
about
lazily
and
bask
in
the
sunshine
at
the
doors
of
their
barracks
Huber
made
an
experiment
He
was
desirous
of
observing
what
would
be
the
result
if
the
great
red
ants
found
themselves
without
servants
whether
they
would
know
how
to
supply
their
own
wants
He
put
a
few
into
a
glass
case
and
put
some
honey
for
them
in
a
corner
so
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
take
it
Miserable
the
degradation
cruel
the
punishment
with
which
slavery
afflicts
the
enslavers
They
did
not
touch
it
they
seemed
to
know
nothing
they
had
become
so
grossly
ignorant
that
they
could
no
longer
feed
themselves
Some
of
them
died
from
starvation
with
food
before
them
Huber
to
complete
the
experiment
then
introduced
into
the
case
one
black
ant
The
presence
of
this
sagacious
slave
changed
the
face
of
things
and
re
established
life
and
order
He
went
straight
to
the
honey
and
fed
the
great
dying
simpletons
The
little
blacks
in
many
things
carry
a
moral
authority
whose
signs
are
very
visible
They
do
not
for
example
permit
the
great
red
ants
to
go
out
alone
on
useless
expeditions
but
compel
them
to
return
into
the
city
Nor
are
they
even
at
liberty
to
go
out
in
a
body
if
their
wise
little
slaves
do
not
think
the
weather
favorable
if
they
fear
a
storm
or
if
the
day
is
far
advanced
When
an
excursion
proves
unsuccessful
and
they
return
without
children
the
little
blacks
are
stationed
at
the
gates
of
the
city
to
forbid
their
ingress
and
send
them
back
to
the
combat
nay
more
you
may
see
them
take
the
cowards
by
the
collar
and
force
them
to
retrace
their
route
These
are
astounding
facts
but
they
were
seen
as
here
described
by
our
illustrious
observer
Not
being
able
to
trust
his
eyes
he
summoned
one
of
the
greatest
naturalists
of
Sweden
Jurine
to
his
side
to
make
new
investigations
and
decide
whether
he
had
been
deceived
This
witness
and
others
who
afterwards
pursued
the
same
course
of
experiments
found
that
his
discoveries
were
entirely
accurate
Yet
after
all
these
weighty
testimonies
I
still
doubted
But
on
a
certain
occasion
I
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
saw
it
in
the
park
of
Fontainebleau
I
was
accompanied
by
an
illustrious
philosopher
an
excellent
observer
and
he
too
saw
exactly
what
I
saw
It
was
half
past
four
in
the
afternoon
of
a
very
warm
day
From
a
pile
of
stones
emerged
a
column
of
from
four
to
five
hundred
red
or
reddish
ants
They
marched
rapidly
towards
a
piece
of
turf
kept
in
order
by
their
sergeants
or
pivot
men
whom
we
saw
on
the
flanks
and
who
would
not
permit
any
one
to
straggle
This
is
a
circumstance
known
to
everyone
who
has
seen
a
file
of
ants
on
the
march
Suddenly
the
mass
seemed
to
sink
and
disappear
There
was
no
sign
of
ant
hills
in
the
turf
but
after
a
while
we
detected
an
almost
imperceptible
orifice
through
which
we
saw
them
vanish
in
less
time
than
it
takes
me
to
write
these
words
We
asked
ourselves
if
it
was
an
entrance
to
their
domicile
if
they
had
re
entered
their
city
In
a
minute
at
the
utmost
they
gave
us
a
reply
and
showed
us
our
mistake
They
issued
in
a
throng
each
carrying
a
captive
in
its
mandibles
From
the
short
time
they
had
taken
it
was
evident
that
they
had
a
previous
knowledge
of
the
locality
the
place
where
the
eggs
were
deposited
the
time
when
they
were
to
assemble
and
the
degree
of
resistance
they
had
to
expect
Perhaps
it
was
not
their
first
journey
The
little
blacks
on
whom
the
red
ants
made
this
raid
sallied
out
in
considerable
numbers
and
I
truly
pitied
them
They
did
not
attempt
to
fight
They
seemed
frightened
and
stunned
They
endeavored
only
to
delay
the
red
ants
by
clinging
to
them
A
red
ant
was
thus
stopped
but
another
red
one
who
was
free
relieved
him
of
his
burden
and
thereupon
the
black
ant
relaxed
his
grasp
It
was
in
fact
a
pitiful
sight
The
blacks
offered
no
serious
resistance
The
five
hundred
ants
succeeded
in
carrying
off
nearly
three
hundred
children
At
two
or
three
feet
from
the
hole
the
blacks
ceased
to
pursue
them
and
resigned
themselves
to
their
fate
All
this
did
not
occupy
ten
minutes
between
the
departure
and
the
return
The
two
parties
were
very
unequal
It
was
very
probably
an
outrage
often
repeated
a
tyranny
of
the
great
who
levied
a
tribute
of
children
from
their
poor
little
neighbors

Oh

Is
my

my
Elihu
A

with

The

s
eyes
were
dim
with
dew
Your

your

He
said
with
trembling
lip
What
little
lad
What
ship
What
little
lad
as
if
there
could
be
Another
such
a
one
as
he
What
little
lad
do
you
say
Why
Elihu
that
took
to
sea
The
moment
I
put
him
off
my
knee
It
was
just
the
other
day
The
Gray
Swan
sailed
away
The
other
day
The
sailor
s
eyes
Stood
open
with
a
great
surprise
The
other
day
The
Swan
His
heart
began
in
his
throat
to
rise
Ay
ay
sir
here
in
the
cupboard
lies
The
jacket
he
had
on
And
so
your
lad
is
gone
Gone
with
the
Swan
And
did
she
stand
With
her
anchor
clutching
hold
of
the
sand
For
a
month
and
never
stir
Why
to
be
sure
I
ve
seen
from
the
land
Like
a
lover
kissing
his
lady
s
hand
The
wild
sea
kissing
her
A
sight
to
remember
sir
But
my
good
mother
do
you
know
All
this
was
twenty
years
ago
I
stood
on
the
Gray
Swan
s
deck
And
to
that
lad
I
saw
you
throw
Taking
it
off
as
it
might
be
so
The
kerchief
from
your
neck
Ay
and
he
ll
bring
it
back
And
did
the
little
lawless
lad
That
has
made
you
sick
and
made
you
sad
Sail
with
the
Gray
Swan
s
crew
Lawless
The
man
is
going
mad
The
best
boy
mother
ever
had
Be
sure
he
sailed
with
the
crew
What
would
you
have
him
do
And
he
has
never
written
line
Nor
sent
you
word
nor
made
you
sign
To
say
he
was
alive
Hold
if
twas
wrong
the
wrong
is
mine
Besides
he
may
be
in
the
brine
And
could
he
write
from
the
grave
Tut
man
What
would
you
have
Gone
twenty
years
a
long
long
cruise
Twas
wicked
thus
your
love
to
abuse
But
if
the
lad
still
live
And
come
back
home
think
you
you
can
Forgive
him
Miserable
man
You
re
mad
as
the
sea
you
rave
What
have
I
to
forgive
The
sailor
twitched
his
shirt
of
blue
And
from
within
his
bosom
drew
The
kerchief
She
was
wild
Oh
God
my
Father
is
it
true
My
little
lad
my
Elihu
And
is
it
is
it
is
it
you
My
blessed
boy
my

My
dead
my
living
child
My
heart
leaps
up
when
I
behold
A
rainbow
in
the
sky
So
was
it
when
my
life
began
So
is
it
now
I
am
a
man
So
be
it
when
I
shall
grow
old
Or
let
me
die
The

And
I

LXIII
THE
CAPTURE
OF
A
WHALE
COOPER
Tom
cried
Barnstable
starting
there
is
the
blow
of
a
whale
Ay
ay
sir
returned
the
cockswain
with
undisturbed
composure
here
is
his
spout
not
half
a
mile
to
seaward
The
easterly
gale
has
driven
the
creature
to
leeward
and
he
begins
to
find
himself
in
shoal
water
He
s
been
sleeping
while
he
should
have
been
working
to
windward
The
fellow
takes
it
coolly
too
He
s
in
no
hurry
to
get
an
offing
I
rather
conclude
sir
said
the
cockswain
rolling
over
his
tobacco
in
his
mouth
very
composedly
while
his
little
sunken
eyes
began
to
twinkle
with
pleasure
at
the
sight
the
gentleman
has
lost
his
reckoning
and
doesn
t
know
which
way
to
head
to
take
himself
back
into
blue
water
Tis
a
fin
back
exclaimed
the
lieutenant
He
will
soon
make
headway
and
be
off
No
sir
tis
a
right
whale
answered
Tom
I
saw
his
spout
He
threw
up
a
pair
of
as
pretty
rainbows
as
one
could
wish
to
see
He
s
a
real
oil
butt
that
fellow
Barnstable
laughed
and
exclaimed
in
joyous
tones
Give
strong
way
my
hearties
There
seems
nothing
better
to
be
done
let
us
have
a
stroke
of
a
harpoon
at
that
impudent
rascal
The
men
shouted
spontaneously
and
the
old
cockswain
suffered
his
solemn
visage
to
relax
into
a
small
laugh
while
the
whale
boat
sprang
forward
like
a
courser
for
the
goal
During
the
few
minutes
they
were
pulling
toward
their
game
Long
Tom
arose
from
his
crouching
attitude
in
the
stern
sheets
and
transferred
his
huge
frame
to
the
bows
of
the
boat
where
he
made
such
preparations
to
strike
the
whale
as
the
occasion
required
The
tub
containing
about
half
a
whale
line
was
placed
at
the
feet
of
Barnstable
who
had
been
preparing
an
oar
to
steer
with
in
place
of
the
rudder
which
was
unshipped
in
order
that
if
necessary
the
boat
might
be
whirled
round
when
not
advancing
Their
approach
was
utterly
unnoticed
by
the
monster
of
the
deep
who
continued
to
amuse
himself
with
throwing
the
water
in
two
circular
spouts
high
into
the
air
occasionally
flourishing
the
broad
flukes
of
his
tail
with
graceful
but
terrific
force
until
the
hardy
seamen
were
within
a
few
hundred
feet
of
him
when
he
suddenly
cast
his
head
downward
and
without
apparent
effort
reared
his
immense
body
for
many
feet
above
the
water
waving
his
tail
violently
and
producing
a
whizzing
noise
that
sounded
like
the
rushing
of
winds
The
cockswain
stood
erect
poising
his
harpoon
ready
for
the
blow
but
when
he
beheld
the
creature
assuming
this
formidable
attitude
he
waved
his
hand
to
his
commander
who
instantly
signed
to
his
men
to
cease
rowing
In
this
situation
the
sportsman
rested
a
few
minutes
while
the
whale
struck
several
blows
on
the
water
in
rapid
succession
the
noise
of
which
re
echoed
along
the
cliffs
like
the
hollow
reports
of
so
many
cannon
After
this
wanton
exhibition
of
his
terrible
strength
the
monster
sank
again
into
his
native
element
and
slowly
disappeared
Which
way
did
he
head
Tom
cried
Barnstable
the
moment
the
whale
was
out
of
sight
Pretty
much
up
and
down
sir
returned
the
cockswain
his
eye
brightening
with
the
excitement
of
the
sport
He
ll
soon
run
his
nose
against
the
bottom
if
he
stands
long
on
that
course
and
will
be
glad
to
get
another
snuff
of
pure
air
Send
her
a
few
fathoms
to
starboard
sir
and
I
promise
we
shall
not
be
out
of
his
track
The
conjecture
of
the
experienced
old
seaman
proved
true
for
in
a
few
minutes
the
water
broke
near
them
and
another
spout
was
cast
into
the
air
when
the
huge
animal
rushed
for
half
his
length
in
the
same
direction
and
fell
on
the
sea
with
a
turbulence
and
foam
equal
to
that
which
is
produced
by
the
launching
of
a
vessel
for
the
first
time
into
its
proper
element
After
this
evolution
the
whale
rolled
heavily
and
seemed
to
rest
from
further
efforts
His
slightest
movements
were
closely
watched
by
Barnstable
and
his
cockswain
and
when
he
was
in
a
state
of
comparative
rest
the
former
gave
the
signal
to
his
crew
to
ply
their
oars
once
more
A
few
long
and
vigorous
strokes
sent
the
boat
directly
up
to
the
broadside
of
the
whale
with
its
bows
pointing
towards
one
of
the
fins
which
was
at
times
as
the
animal
yielded
sluggishly
to
the
action
of
the
waves
exposed
to
view
The
cockswain
poised
his
harpoon
with
much
precision
and
then
darted
it
from
him
with
a
violence
that
buried
the
iron
in
the
body
of
their
foe
The
instant
the
blow
was
made
Long
Tom
shouted
with
singular
earnestness
Starn
all
Stern
all
echoed
Barnstable
when
the
obedient
seamen
by
united
efforts
forced
the
boat
in
a
backward
direction
beyond
the
reach
of
any
blow
from
their
formidable
antagonist
The
alarmed
animal
however
meditated
no
such
resistance
Ignorant
of
his
own
power
and
of
the
insignificance
of
his
enemies
he
sought
refuge
in
flight
One
moment
of
stupid
surprise
succeeded
the
entrance
of
the
iron
then
casting
his
huge
tail
into
the
air
with
a
violence
that
threw
the
sea
around
him
into
increased
commotion
he
disappeared
with
the
quickness
of
lightning
amid

shouted
Barnstable
Hold
on
Tom
he
rises
already
Ay
ay
sir
replied
the
composed
cockswain
seizing
the
line
which
was
running
out
of
the
boat
with
a
velocity
that
rendered
such
a
man
uvre
rather
hazardous
and
causing
it
to
yield
more
gradually
round
the
large
loggerhead
that
was
placed
in
the
bows
of
the
boat
for
that
purpose
Presently
the
line
stretched
forward
and
rising
to
the
surface
with
tremulous
vibrations
it
indicated
the
direction
in
which
the
animal
might
be
expected
to
reappear
Barnstable
had
cast
the
bows
of
the
boat
towards
that
point
before
the
terrified
and
wounded
victim
rose
to
the
surface
His
time
was
however
no
longer
wasted
in
his
sports
but
as
he
ploughed
his
way
along
the
surface
he
forced
the
waters
aside
with
prodigious
energy
The
boat
was
dragged
violently
in
his
wake
and
it
cut
through
the
billows
with
a
terrific
rapidity
that
at
moments
appeared
to
bury
it
in
the
ocean
When
Long
Tom
beheld
his
victim
throwing
his
spouts
on
high
again
he
pointed
with
exultation
to
the
jetting
fluid
which
was
streaked
with
the
deep
red
of
blood
and
cried
Ay
I
ve
touched
the
fellow
s
life
It
must
be
more
than
two
foot
of
blubber
that
stops
my
iron
from
reaching
the
life
of
any
whale
that
ever
sculled
the
ocean
I
believe
you
have
saved
yourself
the
trouble
of
using
the
bayonet
you
have
rigged
for
a
lance
said
his
commander
who
entered
into
the
sport
with
all
the
ardor
of
one
whose
youth
had
been
chiefly
passed
in
such
pursuits
Feel
your
line
Master
Coffin
can
we
haul
alongside
of
our
enemy
I
like
not
the
course
he
is
steering
as
he
tows
us
from
the
schooner
Tis
the
creatur
s
way
sir
said
the
cockswain
You
know
they
need
the
air
in
their
nostrils
when
they
run
the
same
as
a
man
But
lay
hold
boys
and
let
us
haul
up
to
him
The
seamen
now
seized
their
whale
line
and
slowly
drew
their
boat
to
within
a
few
feet
of
the
tail
of
the
fish
whose
progress
became
sensibly
less
rapid
as
he
grew
weak
with
the
loss
of
blood
In
a
few
minutes
he
stopped
running
and
appeared
to
roll
uneasily
on
the
water
as
if
suffering
the
agony
of
death
Shall
we
pull
in
and
finish
him
Tom
cried
Barnstable
A
few
sets
from
your
bayonet
would
do
it
The
cockswain
stood
examining
his
game
with
cool
discretion
and
replied
to
this
interrogatory
No
sir
no
He
s
going
into
his
flurry
there
s
no
occasion
for
using
a
soldier
s
weapon
in
taking
a
whale
Starn
off
sir
starn
off
the
creatur
s
in
his
flurry
The
warning
of
the
prudent
cockswain
was
promptly
obeyed
and
the
boat
cautiously
drew
off
to
a
distance
leaving
to
the
animal
a
clear
space
while
under
its
dying
agonies
From
a
state
of
perfect
rest
the
terrible
monster
threw
its
tail
on
high
as
when
in
sport
but
its
blows
were
trebled
in
rapidity
and
violence
till
all
was
hid
from
view
by
a
pyramid
of
foam
that
was
deeply
dyed
with
blood
The
roarings
of
the
fish
were
like
the
bellowings
of
a
herd
of
bulls
and
it
seemed
as
if
a
thousand
monsters
were
engaged
in
deadly
combat
behind
the
bloody
mist
that
obstructed
the
view
Gradually
these
efforts
subsided
and
when
the
discolored
water
again
settled
down
to
the
long
and
regular
swell
of
the
ocean
the
fish
was
seen
exhausted
and
yielding
passively
to
its
fate
As
life
departed
the
enormous
black
mass
rolled
to
one
side
and
when
the
white
and
glistening
skin
of
the
belly
became
apparent
the
seamen
well
knew
that
their
victory
was
achieved

LXV
THE
MONSTER
OF
THE
NILE
SIR
SAMUEL
BAKER
Few
creatures
are
so
sly
and
wary
as
the
crocodile
I
watch
them
continually
as
they
attack
the
dense
flocks
of
small
birds
that
throng
the
bushes
at
the
water
s
edge
These
birds
are
perfectly
aware
of
the
danger
and
they
fly
from
the
attack
if
possible
The
crocodile
then
quietly
and
innocently
lies
upon
the
surface
as
though
it
had
appeared
quite
by
an
accident
It
thus
attracts
the
attention
of
the
birds
and
it
slowly
sails
away
to
a
considerable
distance
exposed
to
their
view
The
birds
thus
beguiled
by
the
deceiver
believe
that
the
danger
is
removed
and
they
again
flock
to
the
bush
and
once
more
dip
their
thirsty
beaks
in
the
stream
Thus
absorbed
in
slaking
their
thirst
they
do
not
observe
that
their
enemy
is
no
longer
on
the
surface
A
sudden
splash
followed
by
a
huge
pair
of
jaws
beneath
the
bush
which
engulf
some
dozens
of
victims
is
the
signal
unexpectedly
given
of
the
crocodile
s
return
he
having
slily
dived
and
hastened
under
cover
of
water
to
his
victims
I
have
seen
the
crocodile
repeat
this
man
uvre
constantly
they
deceive
by
a
feigned
retreat
and
then
attack
from
below
In
like
manner
the
crocodile
perceives
while
it
is
floating
on
the
surface
in
mid
stream
or
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
a
woman
filling
her
girba
or
an
animal
drinking
Sinking
immediately
it
swims
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
nearer
and
again
appearing
for
an
instant
upon
the
surface
it
assures
itself
of
the
position
of
its
prey
by
a
steady
look
Once
more
it
sinks
and
reaches
the
exact
spot
above
which
the
person
or
animal
may
be
Seeing
distinctly
through
the
water
it
generally
makes
its
fatal
rush
from
beneath
sometimes
seizing
with
its
jaws
and
at
other
times
striking
the
object
into
the
water
with
its
tail
after
which
it
seizes
it
and
carries
it
off
The
crocodile
does
not
attempt
to
swallow
a
large
prey
at
once
but
generally
carries
it
away
and
keeps
it
for
a
considerable
time
in
its
jaws
in
some
deep
hole
beneath
a
rock
or
the
root
of
a
tree
where
it
eats
it
at
leisure
The
tongue
of
the
crocodile
is
so
unlike
that
of
any
other
creature
that
it
can
hardly
be
called
by
the
same
name
No
portion
of
it
is
detached
from
the
flesh
of
the
lower
jaw
it
is
like
a
thickened
membrane
extending
from
the
gullet
to
about
half
way
along
the
length
of
jaw
I
was
one
day
returning
from
head
quarters
to
my
station
a
distance
of
a
mile
and
a
half
along
the
river
s
bank
when
I
noticed
the
large
head
of
a
crocodile
about
thirty
yards
from
the
shore
I
knew
every
inch
of
the
river
and
I
was
satisfied
that
the
water
was
shallow
A
solitary
piece
of
waving
rush
that
grew
upon
the
bank
exactly
opposite
the
crocodile
marked
its
position
So
stooping
down
I
retreated
inland
from
the
bank
and
then
running
forward
I
crept
gently
towards
the
rush
Stooping
as
low
as
possible
I
advanced
till
very
near
the
bank
upon
which
grew
tufts
of
grass
when
by
slowly
raising
my
head
I
could
observe
the
head
of
the
crocodile
in
the
same
position
not
more
than
twenty
six
or
twenty
eight
yards
from
me
At
that
distance
my
rifle
could
hit
a
half
crown
I
therefore
made
sure
of
bagging
The
bank
was
about
four
feet
above
the
water
thus
the
angle
was
favorable
and
I
aimed
just
behind
the
eye
Almost
as
I
touched
the
trigger
the
crocodile
gave
a
convulsive
start
and
turning
slowly
on
its
back
it
stretched
its
four
legs
above
the
surface
straining
every
muscle
It
then
remained
motionless
in
water
about
two
feet
deep
My
horse
was
always
furnished
with
a
long
halter
or
tethering
rope
So
I
ordered
two
men
to
jump
into
the
river
and
secure
the
crocodile
by
a
rope
fastened
round
the
body
behind
the
fore
legs
This
was
quickly
accomplished
and
the
men
remained
knee
deep
hauling
upon
the
rope
to
prevent
the
stream
from
carrying
away
the
body
In
the
meantime
an
attendant
had
mounted
my
horse
and
galloped
off
to
the
camp
for
assistance
Crocodiles
are
very
tenacious
of
life
and
although
they
may
be
shot
through
the
brain
and
be
actually
dead
for
all
practical
purposes
they
will
remain
motionless
at
first
but
they
will
begin
instinctively
to
move
the
limbs
and
tail
a
few
minutes
after
receiving
the
shot
If
lying
upon
a
sand
bank
or
in
deep
water
they
would
generally
disappear
unless
secured
by
a
rope
as
the
spasmodic
movements
of
the
limbs
and
tail
would
act
upon
the
water
and
the
body
would
be
carried
away
The
crocodile
which
had
appeared
stone
dead
now
began
to
move
its
tail
and
my
two
men
who
were
holding
on
to
the
rope
cried
out
that
it
was
still
alive
It
was
in
vain
that
I
assured
the
frightened
fellows
that
it
was
dead
I
was
on
the
bank
and
they
were
in
the
water
within
a
few
feet
of
the
crocodile
which
made
some
difference
in
our
ideas
of
its
vivacity
Presently
the
creature
really
began
to
struggle
and
the
united
efforts
of
the
men
could
hardly
restrain
it
from
getting
into
deeper
water
The
monster
now
began
to
yawn
which
so
terrified
the
men
that
they
would
have
dropped
the
rope
and
fled
had
they
not
been
afraid
of
the
consequences
as
I
was
addressing
them
rather
forcibly
from
the
bank
I
put
another
shot
through
the
shoulder
of
the
struggling
monster
which
appeared
to
act
as
a
narcotic
until
the
arrival
of
the
soldiers
with
ropes
No
sooner
was
the
crocodile
well
secured
than
it
began
to
struggle
violently
But
a
great
number
of
men
hauled
upon
the
rope
and
when
it
was
safely
landed
I
gave
it
a
blow
with
a
sharp
ax
on
the
back
of
the
neck
which
killed
it
by
dividing
the
spine
It
was
now
dragged
along
the
turf
until
we
reached
the
camp
where
it
was
carefully
measured
with
a
tape
and
showed
an
exact
length
of
twelve
feet
three
inches
from
snout
to
end
of
tail
The
stomach
contained
about
five
pounds
weight
of
pebbles
as
though
it
had
fed
upon
flesh
resting
upon
a
gravel
bank
and
had
swallowed
the
pebbles
that
had
adhered
Mixed
with
the
pebbles
was
a
greenish
slimy
matter
that
appeared
woolly
In
the
midst
of
this
were
three
undeniable
witnesses
that
convicted
the
crocodile
of
wilful
murder
A
necklace
and
two
armlets
such
as
are
worn
by
the
negro
girls
were
taken
from
the
stomach
This
was
an
old
malefactor
that
was
a
good
riddance
I
have
frequently
seen
crocodiles
upwards
of
eighteen
feet
in
length
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
they
sometimes
exceed
twenty
but
a
very
small
creature
of
this
species
may
carry
away
a
man
while
swimming

PRAYER
JAMES
MONTGOMERY
Prayer
is
the
soul
s
sincere
desire
Uttered
or
unexpressed
The
motion
of
a
hidden
fire
That
trembles
in
the
breast
Prayer
is
the
burthen
of
a
sigh
The
falling
of
a
tear
The
upward
glancing
of
the
eye
When
none
but
God
is
near
Prayer
is
the
simplest
form
of
speech
That
infant
lips
can
try
Prayer
the
sublimest
strains
that
reach
The
Majesty
on
high
Prayer
is
the
contrite
sinner
s
voice
Returning
from
his
ways
While
angels
in
their
songs
rejoice
And
cry
Behold
he
prays
Prayer
is
the
Christian
s
vital
breath
The
Christian
s
native
air
His
watchword
at
the
gates
of
death
He
enters
Heaven
with
prayer
The
saints
in
prayer
appear
as
one
In
word
and
deed
and
mind
While
with
the
Father
and
the
Son
Sweet
fellowship
they
find
Nor
prayer
is
made
by
man
alone
The
Holy
Spirit
pleads
And
Jesus
on

Throne
For
mourners
intercedes
O
Thou
by
whom
we
come

God
The

Way
The

of
prayer
Thyself

THE
THERMOMETER
All
substances
produce
in
us
when
we
touch
them
the
sensation
of
heat
or
of
cold
The
degree
of
heat
of
any
substance
is
called
its
temperature
and
the
temperature
varies
from
time
to
time
according
to
circumstances
Boiling
water
for
example
contains
so
much
heat
that
it
scalds
the
skin
but
when
removed
from
the
fire
the
water
gradually
becomes
less
and
less
warm
until
at
last
it
contains
so
little
heat
that
it
cools
the
hand
instead
of
scalding
it
Our
feelings
do
not
always
give
us
true
information
about
the
temperature
of
the
bodies
by
which
we
are
surrounded
A
person
comes
into
a
warm
room
from
the
open
air
on
a
cold
day
and
exclaims
How
warm
it
is
here
Another
person
enters
the
same
room
from
one
still
warmer
and
cries
How
cold
it
is
here
The
first
person
gains
heat
and
therefore
calls
the
room
warm
the
second
loses
heat
and
calls
it
cold
while
in
reality
the
air
of
the
room
all
the
while
is
at
the
same
degree
of
temperature
A
nurse
prepares
water
for
a
child
s
bath
and
measures
the
heat
by
the
feeling
of
her
hand
but
she
learns
from
the
quick
and
sudden
cry
of
the
child
when
placed
in
the
bath
that
what
seemed
warm
to
her
is
cold
to
the
child
These
examples
show
that
our
sensations
are
not
always
a
true
test
of
temperature
and
thus
if
we
wish
to
measure
heat
and
cold
accurately
we
must
have
some
instrument
made
for
the
purpose
Such
an
instrument
we
have
it
is
called
a
thermometer
a
word
which
means
heat
measurer
It
was
long
ago
noticed
that
bodies
expand
or
swell
out
when
they
are
heated
and
that
they
contract
or
shrink
into
less
bulk
when
they
are
cooled
This
observation
led
to
the
construction
of
the
thermometer
for
to
measure
the
expansion
or
contraction
of
a
substance
is
the
same
as
to
measure
the
quantity
of
heat
that
has
produced
this
effect
The
thermometer
consists
of
a
small
glass
tube
of
very
fine
bore
and
ending
in
a
hollow
bulb
The
bulb
is
entirely
filled
with
a
fluid
metal
called
mercury
or
quicksilver
which
rises
or
falls
in
the
tube
according
as
it
is
heated
or
cooled
The
space
in
the
tube
above
the
mercury
is
empty
it
does
not
even
contain
air
for
in
preparing
the
instrument
sufficient
heat
is
applied
to
the
bulb
to
make
the
fluid
by
expansion
fill
the
whole
tube
which
is
then
closely
sealed
at
the
upper
end
by
melting
the
glass
the
mercury
sinks
as
it
cools
and
leaves
the
space
empty
The
tube
is
fastened
to
a
metal
or
wooden
plate
marked
so
as
to
measure
the
expansion
of
the
mercury
This
is
called
the
scale
and
the
divisions
upon
it
are
called
degrees
The
degrees
are
counted
upwards
from
the
bottom
and
are
expressed
by
placing
a
small
circle
over
the
number
There
are
three
different
scales
in
use
that
commonly
used
in
this
country
is
called
Fahrenheit
s
scale
from
the
name
of
the
inventor
When
the
tube
of
the
thermometer
is
immersed
in
melting
ice
or
freezing
water
the
upper
surface
of
the
mercury
stands
always
at
the
same
point
which
is
called
the
freezing
point
of
water
On
Fahrenheit
s
thermometer
this
point
is
marked
Again
when
the
bulb
is
held
in
the
steam
of
boiling
water
the
mercury
rises
to
a
fixed
point
which
is
called
the
boiling
point
of
water
and
is
marked
All
bodies
that
are
as
hot
as
boiling
water
raise
the
mercury
to
and
all
bodies
that
are
as
cold
as
freezing
water
make
the
mercury
shrink
to
The
space
between
these
two
points
is
divided
into
equal
parts
each
being
called
a
degree
Similar
equal
divisions
are
carried
below
the
point
marked
till
is
reached
and
this
last
point
is
called
zero
The
tube
of
the
thermometer
may
contain
some
other
fluid
than
mercury
but
as
this
metal
is
in
every
respect
well
fitted
for
the
purpose
it
is
most
generally
used
in
construction
of
the
instrument
The
thermometer
is
one
of
the
most
useful
inventions
of
science
It
enables
travellers
to
compare
the
climates
of
different
countries
and
to
give
us
who
stay
at
home
a
distinct
idea
of
them
It
is
also
necessary
in
the
arts
it
enables
workmen
to
apply
the
exact
amount
of
heat
required
in
delicate
operations
where
a
little
excess
might
spoil
the
whole
work

GOLDEN
DEEDS
What
is
a
golden
deed
It
is
something
which
we
do
for
the
good
of
others
when
we
think
more
of
them
than
we
do
of
ourselves
And
it
is
called
golden
because
the
rarest
and
most
precious
things
in
all
the
world
are
the
acts
of
unselfish
men
Let
me
tell
you
the
story
of
a
golden
deed
that
was
performed
by
Sir
Philip
Sidney
This
brave
English
knight
was
fighting
in
the
Netherlands
to
help
the
Dutch
in
their
struggle
for
liberty
against
the
tyrant
Philip
of
Spain
In
a
fierce
battle
he
was
struck
by
a
musket
ball
which
broke
his
thigh
bone
Thirsty
and
faint
from
loss
of
blood
he
called
for
water
He
had
just
raised
the
cup
to
his
lips
when
his
eye
fell
on
a
poor
dying
soldier
who
was
looking
longingly
at
the
cool
drink
Without
so
much
as
tasting
it
Sidney
handed
the
cup
to
the
poor
fellow
with
these
words
Thy
necessity
is
greater
than
mine
Here
is
the
story
of
another
golden
deed
A
little
boy
named
Peter
who
lived
in
Holland
a
long
time
ago
was
once
on
his
way
home
late
in
the
evening
when
he
became
alarmed
at
hearing
water
trickling
through
a
sluice
or
gate
in
one
of
the
many
dikes
which
are
so
necessary
for
the
safety
of
that
country
for
you
must
know
that
Holland
is
so
flat
and
low
that
it
is
in
constant
danger
of
finding
itself
under
water
He
stopped
and
thought
of
what
would
happen
if
the
hole
were
not
closed
He
had
often
heard
his
father
tell
of
the
sad
disasters
which
had
come
from
such
small
beginnings
as
this
how
in
a
few
hours
the
little
aperture
gradually
enlarged
until
the
whole
defence
was
washed
away
and
the
rolling
dashing
angry
sea
rushed
in
and
swept
on
to
the
next
village
destroying
life
and
property
Should
he
run
home
and
alarm
the
villagers
it
would
be
dark
before
they
could
arrive
and
the
hole
even
then
might
become
so
large
as
to
defy
all
attempts
to
close
What
could
he
do
to
prevent
such
a
terrible
ruin
he
only
a
little
boy
He
sat
down
on
the
bank
of
the
canal
stopped
the
opening
with
his
hand
and
patiently
awaited
the
passing
of
a
villager
But
no
one
came
Hour
after
hour
rolled
by
yet
there
sat
the
heroic
boy
in
cold
and
darkness
shivering
wet
and
tired
but
stoutly
pressing
his
hand
against
the
water
that
was
trying
to
pass
the
dangerous
breach
The
remainder
of
the
story
is
thus
told
by
an
American
poet
Miss
Ph
be
Cary
He
thinks
of
his
brother
and
sister
Asleep
in
their
safe
warm
bed
He
thinks
of
his
father
and
mother
Of
himself
as
dying
and
dead
And
of
how
when
the
night
is
over
They
must
come
and
find
him
at
last
But
he
never
thinks
he
can
leave
the
place
Where
duty
holds
him
fast
The
good
dame
in
the
cottage
Is
up
and
astir
with
the
light
For
the
thought
of
her
little
Peter
Has
been
with
her
all
the
night
And
now
she
watches
the
pathway
As
yester
eve
she
had
done
But
what
does
she
see
so
strange
and
black
Against
the
rising
sun
Her
neighbors
bearing
between
them
Something
straight
to
her
door
Her
child
is
coming
home
but
not
As
he
ever
came
before
He
is
dead
she
cries
my
darling
And
the
startled
father
hears
And
comes
and
looks
the
way
she
looks
And
fears
the
thing
she
fears
Till
a
glad
shout
from
the
bearers
Thrills
the
stricken
man
and
wife
Give
thanks
for
your
son
has
saved
our
land
And
God
has
saved
his
life
So
there
in
the
morning
sunshine
They
knelt
about
the
boy
And
every
head
was
bared
and
bent
In
tearful
reverent
joy
Tis
many
a
year
since
then
but
still
When
the
sea
roars
like
a
flood
Their
boys
are
taught
what
a
boy
can
do
Who
is
brave
and
true
and
good
For
every
man
in
that
country
Takes
his
son
by
the
hand
And
tells
him
of
little
Peter
Whose
courage
saved
the
land
They
have
many
a
valiant
hero
Remembered
through
the
years
But
never
one
whose
name
so
oft
Is
named
with
loving
tears
And
his
deed
shall
be
sung
by
the
cradle
And
told
to
the
child
on
the
knee
As
long
as
the
dikes
of
Holland
Divide
the
land
from
the
sea
Now
let
us
hear
of
a
golden
deed
done
more
than
two
thousand
years
ago
a
deed
that
has
made
the
names
of
Damon
and
Pythias
famous
for
ever
In
Syracuse
there
was
so
hard
a
ruler
that
the
people
made
a
plot
to
drive
him
out
of
the
city
The
plot
was
discovered
and
the
king
commanded
that
the
leaders
should
be
put
to
death
One
of
these
named
Damon
lived
at
some
distance
from
Syracuse
He
asked
that
before
he
was
put
to
death
he
might
be
allowed
to
go
home
to
say
good
bye
to
his
family
promising
that
he
would
then
come
back
to
die
at
the
appointed
time
The
king
did
not
believe
that
he
would
keep
his
word
and
said
I
will
not
let
you
go
unless
you
find
some
friend
who
will
come
and
stay
in
your
place
Then
if
you
are
not
back
on
the
day
set
for
execution
I
shall
put
your
friend
to
death
in
your
stead
The
king
thought
to
himself
Surely
no
one
will
ever
take
the
place
of
a
man
condemned
to
death
Now
Damon
had
a
very
dear
friend
named
Pythias
who
at
once
came
forward
and
offered
to
stay
in
prison
while
Damon
was
allowed
to
go
away
The
king
was
very
much
surprised
but
he
had
given
his
word
Damon
was
therefore
permitted
to
leave
for
home
while
Pythias
was
shut
up
in
prison
Many
days
passed
the
time
for
the
execution
was
close
at
hand
and
Damon
had
not
come
back
The
king
curious
to
see
how
Pythias
would
behave
now
that
death
seemed
so
near
went
to
the
prison
Your
friend
will
never
return
he
said
to
Pythias
You
are
wrong
was
the
answer
Damon
will
be
here
if
he
can
possibly
come
But
he
has
to
travel
by
sea
and
the
winds
have
been
blowing
the
wrong
way
for
several
days
However
it
is
much
better
that
I
should
die
than
he
I
have
no
wife
and
no
children
and
I
love
my
friend
so
well
that
it
would
be
easier
to
die
for
him
than
to
live
without
him
So
I
am
hoping
and
praying
that
he
may
be
delayed
until
my
head
has
fallen
The
king
went
away
more
puzzled
than
ever
The
fatal
day
arrived
Still
Damon
had
not
come
and
Pythias
was
brought
forward
and
mounted
the
scaffold
My
prayers
are
heard
he
cried
I
shall
be
permitted
to
die
for
my
friend
But
mark
my
words
Damon
is
faithful
and
true
you
will
yet
have
reason
to
know
that
he
has
done
his
utmost
to
be
here
Just
at
this
moment
a
man
came
galloping
up
at
full
speed
on
a
horse
covered
with
foam
It
was
Damon
In
an
instant
he
was
on
the
scaffold
and
had
Pythias
in
his
arms
My
beloved
friend
he
cried
the
gods
be
praised
that
you
are
safe
What
agony
have
I
suffered
in
the
fear
that
my
delay
was
putting
your
life
in
danger
There
was
no
joy
in
the
face
of
Pythias
for
he
did
not
care
to
live
if
his
friend
must
die
But
the
king
had
heard
all
At
last
he
was
forced
to
believe
in
the
unselfish
friendship
of
these
two
His
hard
heart
melted
at
the
sight
and
he
set
them
both
free
asking
only
that
they
would
be
his
friends
also

AGE
OF
TREES
Man
counts
his
life
by
years
the
oak
by
centuries
At
one
hundred
years
of
age
the
tree
is
but
a
sapling
at
five
hundred
it
is
mature
and
strong
at
six
hundred
the
gigantic
king
of
the
greenwood
begins
to
feel
the
touch
of
Time
but
the
decline
is
as
slow
as
the
growth
was
and
the
sturdy
old
tree
rears
its
proud
head
and
reckons
centuries
of
old
age
just
as
it
reckoned
centuries
of
youth
It
has
been
said
that
the
patriarch
of
the
forest
laughs
at
history
Is
it
not
true
Perhaps
when
the
balmy
zephyrs
stir
the
trees
the
leaves
whisper
strange
stories
to
one
another
The
oaks
and
the
pines
and
their
brethren
of
the
wood
have
seen
so
many
suns
rise
and
set
so
many
seasons
come
and
go
and
so
many
generations
pass
into
silence
that
we
may
well
wonder
what
the
story
of
the
trees
would
be
to
us
if
they
had
tongues
to
tell
it
or
we
ears
fine
enough
to
understand
The
king
of
white
oak
trees
says
a
letter
writer
in
the
year
has
been
chopped
down
and
taken
to
the
saw
mill
It
was
five
hundred
and
twenty
five
years
old
and
made
six
twelve
foot
logs
the
first
one
being
six
feet
in
diameter
and
weighing
seven
tons
What
a
giant
that
oak
tree
must
have
been
and
what
changes
in
this
land
of
ours
it
must
have
witnessed
It
looked
upon
the
forest
when
the
red
man
ruled
there
alone
it
was
more
than
a
century
old
when
Columbus
landed
in
the
New
World
and
to
that
good
age
it
added
nearly
four
centuries
before
the
ax
of
the
woodman
laid
it
low
Yet
venerable
as
this
king
of
white
oak
trees
was
it
was
but
an
infant
compared
with
other
monarchs
of
the
Western
solitudes
One
California
pine
cut
down
about
was
according
to
very
good
authority
eleven
hundred
and
twenty
years
old
and
many
of
its
neighbors
in
its
native
grove
are
no
less
ancient
than
it
was
Who
shall
presume
then
to
fix
the
age
of
the
hoary
trees
that
still
rear
their
stalwart
frames
in
the
unexplored
depths
of
American
wildernesses
Illustration
In
England
there
are
still
in
existence
many
trees
that
serve
to
link
the
far
off
past
with
the
living
present
Some
of
them
were
witnesses
of
the
fierce
struggles
between
Norman
and
Saxon
when
William
the
Conqueror
planted
his
standard
the
three
bannered
lions
of
Normandy
old
upon
English
soil
Then
there
is
the
King
s
Oak
at
Windsor
which
tradition
informs
us
was
a
great
favorite
with
William
when
that
bold
Norman
first
enclosed
the
forest
for
a
royal
hunting
ground
The
Conqueror
loved
to
sit
in
the
shade
of
the
lofty
spreading
tree
and
muse
upon
what
Who
knows
what
fancies
filled
his
brain
what
feelings
stirred
his
proud
spirit
what
memories
what
regrets
thrilled
his
heart
as
he
sat
there
in
the
solitude
Over
eight
hundred
years
have
rolled
away
since
the
Norman
usurper
fought
the
sturdy
Saxon
and
for
conqueror
as
for
conquered
life
and
its
ambitions
and
its
pangs
ended
long
ago
but
the
mighty
oak
whose
greenness
and
beauty
were
a
delight
to
the
Conqueror
still
stands
in
Windsor
Forest
Eight
centuries
ago
its
royal
master
saw
it
a
goodly
tree
How
old
is
it
now
Older
even
than
this
are
the
oaks
near
Croydon
nine
miles
south
of
London
If
the
botanist
may
judge
by
the
usual
evidences
of
age
these
trees
saw
the
glitter
of
the
Roman
spears
as
the
legions
of
the
Empire
wound
their
way
through
the
forest
paths
or
in
the
green
open
spaces
in
the
woodland
Now

Roman
legions
left

ago
having
been
summoned
home
to
Rome
because
the
Empire
was
in
danger
in
fact
was
hastening
to
its
fall
How
wonderful
if
fourteen
centuries
have
spared
these
oaks
at
Croydon
There
is
a
famous
yew
that
must
not
go
without
notice
in
our
record
of
ancient
trees
This
venerable
tree
stands
in
its
native
field
ever
green
and
enduring
as
if
the
years
had
forgotten
it
Yet
it
was
two
centuries
old
when
in
the
adjacent
meadow
King
John
signed
Magna
Charta
If
we
bear
in
mind
that
in
the
stout
English
barons
compelled
their
wicked
king
to
sign
the
Great
Charter
protecting
the
rights
of
his
subjects
we
may
conclude
that
this
patriarch
yew
is
at
least
eight
hundred
and
fifty
years
old
The
Parliament
Oak
so
called
because
it
is
said
that
Edward
I
who
ruled
England
from
to
once
held
a
Parliament
under
its
branches
is
believed
to
be
fifteen
hundred
years
old
If
Fine
Ear
of
the
fairy
tale
could
come
and
translate
for
us
the
whispers
of
these
ancient
English
trees
and
tell
us
ever
so
little
of
what
the
stately
monarchs
of
the
wood
have
seen
what
new
histories
might
be
written
what
old
chronicles
reversed
On
the
mountains
of
Lebanon
a
few
of
the
cedars
famous
in
sacred
and
in
profane
history
yet
remain
One
of
these
relics
of
the
past
has
been
estimated
to
be
three
thousand
five
hundred
years
old
The
patriarchs
of
the
English
forests
cannot
then
so
far
as
age
is
considered
claim
equal
rank
with
the
cedars
of
Lebanon
But
the
baobab
or
monkey
bread
of
Senegal
must
take
the
first
rank
among
long
lived
trees
Even
the
goodly
trees
of
Lebanon
must
if
ordinary
proofs
can
be
trusted
yield
the
palm
to
their
African
rival
An
eminent
French
botanist
of
the
eighteenth
century
whose
discoveries
in
natural
history
are
of
great
interest
to
the
world
of
science
lived
some
years
in
Senegal
and
had
ample
opportunity
to
observe
and
study
the
wonderful
baobab
He
saw
several
trees
of
this
species
growing
and
from
the
most
careful
calculations
he
formed
his
opinion
as
to
the
age
of
some
of
these
African
wonders
One
baobab
which
even
in
its
decay
measured
one
hundred
and
nine
feet
in
circumference
he
believed
to
be
more
than
five
thousand
years
old
Truly
the
patriarchs
of
the
forest
laugh
at
history

LXXII
HEAT
CONDUCTION
AND
RADIATION
In
a
former
lesson
you
read
a
description
of
the
thermometer
a
useful
instrument
which
enables
us
to
estimate
the
temperature
or
sensible
heat
of
substances
All
bodies
even
the
coldest
contain
heat
and
they
have
also
a
tendency
to
part
with
their
heat
to
colder
substances
around
them
until
all
have
the
same
temperature
Thus
when
you
lay
your
hand
on
a
block
of
iron
or
marble
heat
leaves
your
hand
to
enter
the
less
warm
material
and
raise
its
temperature
and
it
is
this
abstraction
of
heat
that
produces
in
you
the
sensation
of
cold
There
is
then
a
constant
communication
or
transmission
of
heat
from
one
body
to
another
This
communication
is
effected
chiefly
in
two
ways
by
conduction
and
by
radiation
In
conduction
the
bodies
are
in
contact
in
radiation
they
are
at
some
distance
apart
If
you
push
one
end
of
a
cold
poker
into
the
fire
that
end
will
soon
become
warm
and
the
heat
will
be
propagated
from
particle
to
particle
through
the
poker
until
the
end
most
distant
from
the
fire
becomes
too
hot
to
be
touched
without
injury
This
mode
of
transmission
is
called
conduction
Different
substances
possess
this
power
in
very
different
degrees
Thus
if
instead
of
a
poker
you
thrust
into
the
fire
a
bar
of
wood
of
equal
length
and
thickness
you
will
find
that
even
when
the
inserted
end
is
in
flames
the
other
remains
comparatively
cold
and
may
be
handled
with
impunity
Hence
we
say
that
iron
is
a
good
conductor
and
wood
a
bad
conductor
of
heat
The
conducting
power
of
bodies
depends
in
a
great
measure
on
the
closeness
of
their
particles
dense
solid
substances
being
much
better
conductors
than
those
which
are
light
and
porous
The
metals
are
the
best
conductors
but
they
differ
very
much
among
themselves
The
best
is
silver
the
others
stand
in
this
respect
in
the
following
order
copper
gold
brass
tin
iron
steel
lead
You
will
now
understand
why
metals
feel
cold
to
the
touch
it
is
because
being
good
conductors
they
carry
the
heat
rapidly
away
from
that
part
of
our
body
with
which
they
are
in
contact
Among
the
bad
conductors
of
heat
are
fur
wool
cotton
silk
and
linen
straw
paper
feathers
wood
earth
snow
water
and
air
and
loose
bodies
such
as
sawdust
and
shavings
which
contain
a
large
amount
of
air
in
the
spaces
between
their
particles
Our
clothing
as
you
know
is
made
of
wool
cotton
or
linen
Can
you
tell
why
such
materials
are
selected
for
the
purpose
It
is
not
as
many
ignorant
people
suppose
because
they
are
best
adapted
to
impart
warmth
The
true
reason
is
that
being
bad
conductors
they
prevent
the
cold
air
and
other
objects
around
us
from
robbing
us
of
the
heat
which
is
produced
within
our
bodies
When
once
you
understand
what
is
meant
by
conduction
of
heat
and
can
distinguish
between
substances
which
are
good
conductors
and
those
which
are
not
you
will
be
able
to
give
a
reason
for
many
facts
that
must
appear
strange
to
every
one
who
does
not
possess
such
information
A
little
reflection
for
instance
will
enable
you
to
explain
why
a
linen
garment
feels
colder
to
the
skin
than
one
made
of
cotton
or
wool
why
a
silver
spoon
becomes
hot
when
the
bowl
is
left
for
a
few
minutes
in
a
cup
of
hot
liquid
why
a
metal
tea
pot
or
kettle
is
commonly
furnished
with
a
handle
of
wood
or
ivory
why
ice
may
be
preserved
by
being
wrapped
in
flannel
or
covered
with
sawdust
why
a
pump
in
frosty
weather
should
be
encased
in
straw
or
matting
and
why
the
farmer
welcomes
the
snow
and
regards
it
as
a
protection
to
his
crops
Every
warm
body
has
the
power
of
sending
out
rays
of
heat
as
a
luminous
body
gives
out
rays
of
light
This
mode
of
communicating
heat
is
called
radiation
and
it
serves
as
we
shall
see
a
very
important
purpose
in
the
economy
of
nature
When
you
stand
before
a
fire
heat
rays
stream
forth
from
the
burning
fuel
and
create
in
you
the
sensation
of
warmth
In
this
case
the
heat
of
the
fire
is
communicated
to
you
not
by
conduction
but
by
radiation
Everything
in
nature
is
constantly
radiating
heat
from
its
surface
If
a
body
be
surrounded
by
objects
hotter
than
itself
it
becomes
heated
by
radiation
if
it
be
exposed
to
the
influence
of
objects
colder
than
itself
it
becomes
cooled
by
radiation
and
if
the
objects
around
it
are
neither
hotter
nor
colder
than
itself
its
temperature
remains
unaltered
But
though
all
bodies
radiate
heat
they
have
not
all
the
same
radiating
power
Some
substances
possess
this
power
in
a
far
greater
degree
than
others
The
metals
though
they
are
the
best
conductors
are
the
worst
radiators
This
is
particularly
the
case
when
they
are
polished
Dull
dark
substances
and
especially
those
which
have
a
rough
or
scratched
surface
are
good
radiators
light
colored
and
smooth
substances
on
the
other
hand
are
bad
radiators
and
this
explains
why
as
every
good
housewife
knows
a
polished
metal
tea
pot
keeps
tea
warmer
than
a
black
earthen
one
it
does
not
part
with
its
heat
so
readily
Bodies
which
radiate
freely
have
the
power
in
an
equal
degree
of
absorbing
heat
that
is
they
are
as
ready
to
take
it
in
as
they
are
to
throw
it
out
again
Dark
substances
therefore
must
be
good
absorbers
as
they
are
good
radiators
of
heat
A
very
simple
experiment
will
illustrate
this
fact
very
clearly
If
you
spread
upon
snow
in
a
place
exposed
to
the
sunbeams
two
pieces
of
cloth
of
the
same
texture
one
black
and
the
other
white
you
will
find
after
some
time
that
under
the
black
cloth
the
snow
has
been
melted
but
under
the
white
cloth
it
remains
as
it
was
at
first
The
black
material
has
been
heated
quickly
and
intensely
the
white
has
not
been
heated
at
all
the
former
has
absorbed
the
sun
s
rays
the
latter
has
reflected
them
The
laws
of
absorption
and
radiation
enable
us
to
explain
many
curious
facts
Thus
dark
colored
clothes
are
cold
in
the
shade
because
they
are
then
radiating
heat
from
our
bodies
but
they
are
warm
in
the
sunshine
because
they
are
then
absorbing
the
heat
that
falls
upon
them
from
the
sun
On
the
other
hand
light
colored
clothes
are
warm
in
the
shade
and
cool
in
the
sunshine
Again
a
dish
cover
or
metal
tea
pot
is
kept
as
brightly
polished
as
possible
in
order
to
prevent
the
escape
of
the
heat
by
radiation
a
black
earthenware
tea
pot
on
the
contrary
has
a
dull
and
dark
surface
so
that
it
may
be
placed
on
the
hob
and
absorb
the
heat
So
too
if
a
kettle
is
to
heat
quickly
the
bottom
and
sides
should
be
covered
with
soot
to
absorb
the
heat
while
the
upper
part
should
be
bright
to
prevent
radiation
It
is
radiation
also
that
accounts
for
the
deposition
of
dew
It
is
a
common
error
to
suppose
that
dew
falls
in
the
same
manner
as
rain
or
mist
only
in
much
finer
particles
Dew
in
fact
does
not
fall
but
is
formed
on
the
surface
of
bodies
by
the
condensation
of
the
moisture
of
the
atmosphere
The
air
around
us
contains
at
all
times
a
quantity
of
moisture
in
the
form
of
vapor
Now
this
vapor
has
been
formed
from
water
by
the
action
of
heat
and
it
may
again
be
turned
into
water
by
being
brought
in
contact
with
objects
that
are
cold
And
this
is
just
what
takes
place
in
the
formation
of
dew
When
the
sun
has
set
the
trees
and
grass
and
other
objects
on
the
earth
s
surface
immediately
begin
to
radiate
the
heat
which
they
have
absorbed
from
its
beams
during
the
day
The
best
radiators
of
course
become
cool
most
rapidly
and
quickly
condense
the
vapor
that
floats
in
the
air
around
them
and
in
the
morning
we
find
those
objects
which
radiate
freely
such
as
blades
of
grass
leaves
of
plants
and
floating
cobwebs
covered
with
this
condensed
vapor
in
the
form
of
glittering
dewdrops
Clouds
in
a
great
measure
prevent
radiation
and
hence
the
dew
will
be
most
plentiful
on
a
clear
and
cloudless
night
If
the
radiation
continues
till
the
temperature
of
the
ground
is
very
low
the
dew
freezes
as
it
is
deposited
and
forms
hoar
frost
You
may
see
a
smooth
road
or
gravel
walk
quite
dry
in
the
morning
while
the
grass
or
box
by
its
side
is
thickly
coated
with
moisture
Why
is
this
It
is
simply
because
the
road
or
walk
is
a
bad
radiator
and
cools
slowly
while
the
grass
and
box
being
good
radiators
become
rapidly
cold
and
condense
the
vapor
of
the
passing
air
into
dew
Thus
by
a
wise
arrangement
the
cultivated
fields
receive
an
abundance
of
precious
moisture
while
not
a
drop
is
wasted
on
the
bare
rock
or
the
sterile
sands
of
the
desert

LXXIII
WHEN
ALL
THY
MERCIES
O
MY
GOD
JOSEPH
ADDISON
When
all
Thy
mercies
O
my
God
My
rising
soul
surveys
Transported
with
the
view
I
m
lost
In
wonder
love
and
praise
O
how
shall
words
with
equal
warmth
The
gratitude
declare
That
glows
within
my
ravished
heart
But
Thou
canst
read
it
there
Thy
Providence
my
life
sustained
And
all
my
wants
redressed
When
in
the
silent
womb
I
lay
And
hung
upon
the
breast
To
all
my
weak
complaints
and
cries
Thy
mercy
lent
an
ear
Ere
yet
my
feeble
thoughts
had
learnt
To
form
themselves
in
prayer
Unnumbered
comforts
to
my
soul
Thy
tender
care
bestowed
Before
my
infant
heart
conceived
From
whence
these
comforts
flowed
When
in
the
slippery
paths
of
youth
With
heedless
steps
I
ran
Thine
arm
unseen
conveyed
me
safe
And
led
me
up
to
man
Through
hidden
dangers
toils
and
death
It
gently
cleared
my
way
And
through
the
pleasing
snares
of
vice
More
to
be
feared
than
they
When
worn
with
sickness
oft
hast
Thou
With
health
renewed
my
face
And
when
in
sins
and
sorrows
sunk
Revived
my
soul
with
grace
Thy
bounteous
hand
with
worldly
bliss
Has
made
my
cup
run
o
er
And
in
a
kind
and
faithful
friend
Has
doubled
all
my
store
Ten
thousand
thousand
precious
gifts
My
daily
thanks
employ
Nor
is
the
least
a
cheerful
heart
That
tastes
those
gifts
with
joy
Through
every
period
of
my
life
Thy
goodness
I
ll

The
glorious
theme

When

Divide

more
My
ever
grateful
heart
O
Lord
Thy
mercy
shall
adore
Through
all

to
Thee
A
joyful
song
I

But
O

To

CANADIAN

FIRST
READING
SOFT
WOODS
The
principal
evergreen
or
cone
bearing
trees
natives
of
Canada
are
Pines
Firs
and
Thujas
As
every
one
cannot
distinguish
a
Pine
from
a
Fir
this
lesson
is
illustrated
with
drawings
showing
the
peculiar
character
of
each
so
that
any
boy
or
girl
may
be
able
when
looking
at
a
cone
bearing
tree
to
decide
whether
it
is
a
Pine
or
a
Fir
Fig
represents
a
small
piece
of
the
twig
of
a
White
Pine
On
examination
it
will
be
seen
that
the
leaves
are
needle
shaped
and
spring
from
the
young
shoot
in
little
tufts
of
fives
all
issuing
from
one
point
This
arrangement
and
form
of
the
leaf
are
peculiar
to
Pines
and
should
be
kept
in
mind
when
examining
a
tree
in
order
to
know
whether
it
is
a
Pine
or
a
Fir
Every
Pine
tree
however
has
not
five
leaves
issuing
from
one
point
some
have
only
two
and
there
are
others
again
that
have
three
Illustration

Fig
represents
a
twig
of
the
Hemlock
Spruce
Fir
a
tree
well
known
to
nearly
every
young
person
in
Canada
Looking
at
this
illustration
we
at
once
observe
that
the
leaves
are
distributed
singly
on
the
young
shoot
and
stand
out
in
two
rows
In
the
case
of
a
few
species
of
Fir
however
the
leaves
are
not
thus
arranged
but
are
scattered
all
round
the
twigs
being
stiff
and
pointed
as
shown
in
Fig
which
represents
a
twig
of
the
common
Black
Spruce
Fir
In
all
cases
Firs
have
their
leaves
springing
singly
from
the
twigs
an
arrangement
by
which
any
child
can
distinguish
them
from
Pines
Illustration
FIG
Of
all
our
native
trees
Pines
are
considered
the
most
valuable
as
their
timber
can
be
used
for
almost
every
purpose
for
which
wood
is
required
especially
for
house
building
ship
building
fencing
and
railway
construction
The
two
principal
species
are
the
White
and
the
Red
Pine
Illustration
FIG
The
White
Pine
is
one
of
the
grandest
trees
of
our
Canadian
forests
It
grows
to
very
large
proportions
on
dry
gravelly
lands
where
it
is
not
crowded
by
other
trees
We
often
find
individual
pine
trees
rising
to
the
height
of
feet
with
stems
from
four
to
six
feet
in
diameter
near
the
ground
but
in
general
they
may
be
said
to
reach
feet
with
a
diameter
of
about
three
feet
In
the
earlier
settled
parts
of
the
country
the
best
and
largest
trees
of
this
species
were
cut
down
long
ago
but
thousands
of
fine
specimens
are
still
to
be
met
with
in
the
backwoods
The
Red
Pine
does
not
grow
to
so
large
a
size
as
the
White
nor
is
it
found
so
plentifully
in
our
forests
It
is
to
be
met
with
only
on
dry
gravelly
knolls
and
in
rocky
parts
of
the
country
generally
in
patches
of
small
extent
and
seldom
among
other
trees
Its
timber
is
of
the
best
description
and
is
much
sought
after
by
lumbermen
Owing
to
this
cause
it
is
now
comparatively
scarce
All
Pines
are
reared
from
seeds
which
may
be
found
ripe
in
their
cones
in
the
month
of
November
Although
our
Fir
trees
are
generally
speaking
not
so
important
as
our
Pines
still
there
are
two
or
three
of
them
well
worthy
of
being
brought
under
notice
here
particularly
the
Douglas
Fir
the
Hemlock
Spruce
Fir
the
common
Black
Spruce
Fir
and
the
Balsam
Fir
The
Douglas
Fir
is
not
found
in
the
woods
east
of
the
Rocky
Mountains
but
it
grows
in
the
immense
forests
of
British
Columbia
to
heights
varying
from
to
feet
with
trunks
from
three
to
ten
feet
in
diameter
A
peculiar
feature
of
this
Fir
is
that
the
bark
on
old
trees
is
found
from
ten
to
fourteen
inches
thick
Where
full
grown
this
grand
Fir
usually
stands
apart
from
other
trees
and
forms
a
majestic
object
in
the
landscape
being
clothed
with
horizontal
branches
from
the
base
to
the
top
The
timber
is
exceedingly
durable
and
in
its
native
province
is
much
used
for
general
purposes
It
is
also
exported
for
ship
masts
the
tall
clean
stems
making
the
best
of
material
for
this
purpose
The
Hemlock
Spruce
Fir
most
young
people
of
Canada
are
acquainted
with
as
it
is
widely
distributed
and
found
in
many
bushes
of
the
country
In
open
situations
and
on
cool
bottomed
lands
the
Hemlock
is
a
noble
tree
while
young
it
is
very
graceful
in
form
and
when
approaching
maturity
its
horizontal
limbs
give
it
the
appearance
of
the
Cedar
of
Lebanon
Its
timber
however
is
not
esteemed
so
highly
as
that
of
the
Pine
being
of
a
loose
and
open
character
But
although
this
is
the
case
it
is
largely
used
for
rough
boarding
purposes
as
in
building
barns
and
in
making
side
walks
The
bark
of
this
tree
is
valuable
for
tanning
leather
The
Black
Spruce
Fir
or
Gum
Spruce
as
it
is
often
called
is
very
common
on
most
flat
and
cool
bottomed
lands
in
Canada
and
also
on
the
banks
of
lakes
and
rivers
It
is
a
tall
and
beautifully
formed
tree
having
a
dark
brown
bark
and
very
dark
green
leaves
It
is
from
these
characteristics
that
it
derives
its
name
It
grows
to
a
height
varying
from
to
feet
but
the
stems
seldom
attain
diameters
over
two
feet
at
the
bottom
The
timber
though
light
is
very
tough
and
strong
The
Balsam
is
one
of
the
handsomest
members
of
this
family
Commercially
it
is
not
of
much
value
but
as
an
ornamental
tree
it
is
unsurpassed
its
regular
conical
form
closely
set
branches
and
deep
green
leaves
rendering
it
a
conspicuous
object
in
any
landscape
The
Balsam
seldom
exceeds
forty
or
fifty
feet
in
height
Although
the
Firs
like
the
Pines
are
reared
from
seeds
which
ripen
in
October
and
November
they
may
be
grown
from
cuttings
of
the
young
wood
as
rare
kinds
sometimes
are
when
their
seeds
cannot
be
had
The
Thuja
or
Arbor
vit
as
it
is
generally
called
is
a
very
useful
class
of
Canadian
trees
It
grows
to
a
large
size
and
is
found
chiefly
on
the
Pacific
slope
There
is
only
one
species
which
is
a
native
of
Ontario
and
to
it
alone
we
shall
here
refer
It
is
known
to
most
people
in
Ontario
under
the
name
of
the
White
Cedar
How
it
came
to
be
called
a
Cedar
we
do
not
know
but
its
true
name
is
the
Arbor
vit
This
species
is
too
familiar
to
the
people
of
the
eastern
provinces
of
Canada
to
require
any
lengthened
description
as
many
farmers
have
it
growing
in
the
swampy
parts
of
their
bushes
and
find
it
useful
for
various
purposes
especially
as
rails
for
fencing
The
leaves
of
this
tree
are
so
small
that
to
a
casual
observer
they
scarcely
appear
to
be
leaves
If
they
are
closely
looked
at
however
it
will
be
seen
that
they
are
in
opposite
pairs
and
lie
flat
and
pressed
on
the
twigs
each
pair
overlapping
the
other
like
the
shingles
on
a
house
top
When
they
are
roughly
handled
they
give
out
a
strong
aromatic
smell
The
tree
although
it
grows
to
large
dimensions
some
times
to
eighty
or
ninety
feet
in
height
with
stems
from
two
to
three
feet
in
diameter
cannot
be
considered
an
ornamental
one
as
its
branches
are
too
loose
and
open
and
its
leaves
too
small
to
give
it
a
clothed
look
Its
timber
however
is
of
the
most
valuable
description
being
very
durable
and
in
this
respect
it
is
not
surpassed
by
any
other
tree
Much
of
it
is
used
for
railway
ties
The
Thujas
are
all
grown
from
seeds
but
like
the
Firs
they
may
be
reared
from
cuttings
LXXV
BINGEN
ON
THE
RHINE
HON
MRS
NORTON
A
soldier
of
the
Legion
lay
dying
in
Algiers
There
was
lack
of
woman
s
nursing
there
was
dearth
of
woman
s
tears
But
a
comrade
stood
beside
him
while
his
life
blood
ebbed
away
And
bent
with
pitying
glances
to
hear
what
he
might
say
The
dying
soldier
faltered
as
he
took
that
comrade
s
hand
And
he
said
I
never
more
shall
see
my
own
my
native
land
Take
a
message
and
a
token
to
some
distant
friends
of
mine
For
I
was
born
at
Bingen
at
Bingen
on
the
Rhine
Tell
my
brothers
and
companions
when
they
meet
and
crowd
around
To
hear
my
mournful
story
in
the
pleasant
vineyard
ground
That
we
fought
the
battle
bravely
and
when
the
day
was
done
Full
many
a
corpse
lay
ghastly
pale
beneath
the
setting
sun
And
mid
the
dead
and
dying
were
some
grown
old
in
wars
The
death
wound
on
their
gallant
breasts
the
last
of
many
scars
But
some
were
young
and
suddenly
beheld
life
s
morn
decline
And
one
had
come
from
Bingen
fair
Bingen
on
the
Rhine
Tell
my
mother
that
her
other
sons
shall
comfort
her
old
age
And
I
was
aye
a
truant
bird
that
thought
his
home
a
cage
For
my
father
was
a
soldier
and
even
as
a
child
My
heart
leaped
forth
to
hear
him
tell
of
struggles
fierce
and
wild
And
when
he
died
and
left
us
to
divide
his
scanty
hoard
I
let
them
take
whate
er
they
would
but
kept
my
father
s
sword
And
with
boyish
love
I
hung
it
where
the
bright
light
used
to
shine
On
the
cottage
wall
at
Bingen
calm
Bingen
on
the
Rhine
Tell
my
sister
not
to
weep
for
me
and
sob
with
drooping
head
When
the
troops
are
marching
home
again
with
glad
and
gallant
tread
But
to
look
upon
them
proudly
with
a
calm
and
steadfast
eye
For
her
brother
was
a
soldier
too
and
not
afraid
to
die
And
if
a
comrade
seek
her
love
I
ask
her
in
my
name
To
listen
to
him
kindly
without
regret
or
shame
And
to
hang
the
old
sword
in
its
place
my
father
s
sword
and
mine
For
the
honor
of
old
Bingen
dear
Bingen
on
the
Rhine
There
s
another
not
a
sister
in
the
happy
days
gone
by
You
d
have
known
her
by
the
merriment
that
sparkled
in
her
eye
Too
innocent
for
coquetry
too
fond
for
idle
scorning
O
friend
I
fear
the
lightest
heart
makes
sometimes
heaviest
mourning
Tell
her
the
last
night
of
my
life
for
ere
this
moon
be
risen
My
body
will
be
out
of
pain
my
soul
be
out
of
prison
I
dreamed
I
stood
with
her
and
saw
the
yellow
sunlight
shine
On
the
vine
clad
hills
of
Bingen
fair
Bingen
on
the
Rhine
I
saw
the
blue
Rhine
sweep
along
I
heard
or
seemed
to
hear
The
German
songs
we
used
to
sing
in
chorus
sweet
and
clear
And
down
the
pleasant
river
and
up
the
slanting
hill
That
echoing
chorus
sounded
through
the
evening
calm
and
still
And
her
glad
blue
eyes
were
on
me
as
we
passed
with
friendly
talk
Down
many
a
path
beloved
of
yore
and
well
remembered
walk
And
her
little
hand
lay
lightly
confidingly
in
mine
But
we
ll
meet
no
more
at
Bingen
loved
Bingen
on
the
Rhine
His
voice
grew
faint
and
hoarser
his
grasp
was
childish
weak
His
eyes
put
on
a
dying
look
he
sighed
and
ceased
to
speak
His
comrade
bent
to
lift
him
but
the
spark
of
life
had
fled
The
soldier
of
the
Legion
in
a
foreign
land
was
dead
And
the
soft
moon
rose
up
slowly
and
calmly
she
looked
down
On
the
red
sand
of
the
battle
field
with
bloody
corpses
strewn
Yea
calmly
on
that
dreadful
scene
her

LXXVI
CANADIAN
TREES
JAMES
BROWN
LL
D
SECOND
READING
HARD
WOODS
Let
us
now
briefly
describe
the
principal
varieties
of
our
Canadian
trees
which
lose
their
leaves
every
autumn
and
are
therefore
called
Deciduous
Trees
and
first
we
shall
begin
with
the
Oak
There
are
at
least
thirty
different
species
of
Oaks
found
in
our
Canadian
forests
all
growing
to
a
size
that
makes
them
valuable
as
timber
Most
of
them
form
noble
specimens
of
ornamental
trees
when
they
stand
out
free
and
separate
from
each
other
The
White
Oak
when
so
found
is
one
of
the
grandest
objects
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
The
seeds
of
the
Oak
which
are
called
acorns
are
found
ripe
on
the
trees
in
October
and
November
There
are
about
ten
different
species
of
Maples
found
in
our
woods
all
beautiful
and
ornamental
trees
The
Sugar
Maple
is
a
tree
of
especial
beauty
and
in
the
autumn
months
is
remarkable
for
the
brilliant
color
of
its
leaves
The
seeds
of
the
Maple
are
what
is
called
winged
They
may
be
found
lying
under
the
old
trees
in
autumn
The
Ash
is
another
valuable
Canadian
tree
and
of
this
genus
about
twenty
species
are
found
in
our
forests
All
are
more
or
less
valuable
both
for
their
timber
and
for
their
ornamental
qualities
Several
of
the
species
especially
those
called
the
White
and
the
Black
Ash
are
found
upwards
of
feet
in
height
with
diameters
close
to
the
ground
of
three
to
four
feet
through
The
timber
is
much
prized
for
its
toughness
and
strength
and
is
used
in
the
manufacture
of
implements
barrel
hoops
and
the
wood
work
of
machinery
The
Ash
is
always
found
on
deep
land
having
a
rather
damp
and
cool
bottom
The
seeds
are
ripe
in
November
and
may
then
be
gathered
from
the
trees
Of
the
Beech
there
is
only
one
species
found
in
Canada
but
here
and
there
varieties
of
it
are
to
be
met
with
caused
by
difference
of
soil
and
aspect
It
grows
to
a
large
size
when
not
closely
surrounded
by
other
trees
Its
timber
is
held
in
high
esteem
but
as
it
does
not
last
long
when
exposed
to
the
weather
it
should
therefore
be
used
for
indoor
purposes
only
The
Beech
is
not
a
long
lived
tree
as
it
becomes
matured
within
years
It
succeeds
best
on
dry
gravelly
soils
The
seeds
are
called
nuts
and
are
ripe
in
October
as
every
country
schoolboy
knows
The
Sweet
Chestnut
is
another
of
our
timber
trees
deserving
of
notice
There
is
only
one
species
of
it
to
be
found
in
Canada
and
it
is
in
all
respects
the
same
as
the
European
Sweet
Chestnut
It
is
a
majestic
tree
where
found
standing
alone
and
its
timber
is
of
a
very
durable
nature
much
sought
after
for
many
purposes
especially
for
posts
and
fence
rails
This
tree
grows
best
on
deep
dry
and
strong
land
where
it
often
reaches
a
height
of
feet
with
a
proportionate
trunk
The
seeds
are
called
nuts
and
may
be
used
as
food
The
Hornbeam
or
Ironwood
as
it
is
generally
called
in
Canada
is
a
tree
of
moderate
size
and
is
plentiful
on
the
dry
parts
of
our
forest
land
It
has
much
the
same
appearance
as
the
Beech
but
it
is
easily
distinguished
from
that
tree
by
the
curled
edges
of
its
leaves
and
by
its
darker
and
rougher
bark
The
timber
is
very
hard
of
a
close
and
compact
texture
and
is
much
used
for
farm
purposes
where
strength
is
required
The
seeds
of
this
tree
are
called
nuts
and
each
is
enclosed
in
a
peculiar
leafy
substance
called
by
botanists
a
perianth
The
Walnut
is
found
plentifully
in
most
bushes
in
the
southern
parts
of
Ontario
It
includes
nine
or
ten
species
all
growing
to
considerable
size
and
forming
very
handsome
trees
as
for
example
the
Black
Walnut
Butternut
Pecan
Nut
Hickory
Bitter
Nut
and
Hog
Nut
each
having
beautiful
foliage
The
Hickory
is
especially
known
for
the
toughness
and
other
valuable
qualities
of
its
timber
and
every
boy
is
familiar
with
the
delicious
nuts
which
this
tree
produces
All
these
trees
grow
best
on
a
deep
rich
soil
The
Plane
is
another
member
of
our
Canadian
forests
deserving
of
notice
and
is
a
tree
of
peculiar
beauty
Its
wide
spreading
branches
clothed
with
large
leaves
make
it
well
adapted
for
shelter
or
shade
In
Canada
it
is
best
known
by
the
name
of
Cotton
wood
or
Button
wood
and
is
also
familiar
as
the
Sycamore
The
British
name
for
it
is
the
Plane
Tree
It
is
found
on
deep
loamy
lands
by
the
sides
of
our
rivers
and
lakes
forming
a
tall
massive
headed
tree
often
upwards
of
feet
in
height
with
a
trunk
of
from
three
to
five
feet
in
diameter
The
timber
is
not
held
in
high
estimation
though
sometimes
used
for
furniture
making
and
for
some
parts
of
the
inner
work
of
house
building
The
tree
can
be
grown
from
cuttings
of
the
young
wood
The
Elm
in
our
woods
is
a
stately
tree
and
often
rises
to
the
height
of
feet
with
a
stem
of
six
feet
in
diameter
There
are
several
species
of
Elm
but
the
most
important
is
the
White
which
on
deep
and
cool
bottomed
land
attains
the
dimensions
stated
Where
individuals
of
this
species
stand
alone
with
all
their
limbs
fully
developed
they
form
grand
and
imposing
objects
The
timber
of
the
various
species
is
used
in
house
building
and
in
the
manufacture
of
agricultural
implements
The
seeds
ripen
in
the
early
part
of
summer
when
they
may
be
gathered
and
sown
at
once
Of
the
Birch
there
are
several
species
found
in
our
woods
but
the
Tall
Birch
and
the
Paper
Birch
are
the
most
important
and
best
known
Both
species
are
of
graceful
habit
and
foliage
The
Paper
Birch
is
particularly
remarkable
on
account
of
its
cream
colored
paper
like
bark
Both
kinds
attain
large
dimensions
in
favorable
soil
being
often
found
from
to
feet
high
with
stems
of
two
or
three
feet
in
diameter
It
is
from
the
bark
of
the
Paper
Birch
that
the
Indians
construct
their
canoes
hence
it
is
often
called
the
Canoe
Birch
The
timber
of
this
tree
enters
largely
into
the
manufacture
of
furniture
and
for
this
purpose
it
is
exported
to
Europe
The
seeds
are
contained
in
catkins
which
hang
from
the
points
of
the
branches
and
ripen
in
October
The
Tulip
may
be
easily
known
by
its
leaves
which
are
quite
unlike
those
of
almost
any
other
tree
and
much
resemble
a
riding
saddle
It
grows
to
a
large
size
and
is
highly
ornamental
its
luxuriant
foliage
together
with
its
numerous
greenish
yellow
tulip
shaped
flowers
giving
it
a
fine
appearance
The
timber
is
soft
and
of
no
especial
value
There
is
only
one
species
Of
the
Lime
we
have
four
different
species
in
our
woods
namely
the
Broad
leaved
the
Downy
leaved
the
Thin
leaved
and
the
Variable
leaved
This
tree
is
more
generally
known
to
Canadians
by
the
name
of
Basswood
All
the
species
are
graceful
trees
with
sweet
smelling
flowers
Many
of
them
grow
to
a
large
size
on
rich
deep
lands
often
attaining
the
height
of
feet
with
stems
ranging
from
three
to
five
feet
in
diameter
The
timber
is
white
and
soft
when
newly
cut
up
but
as
it
becomes
seasoned
it
acquires
firmness
of
texture
and
when
kept
dry
lasts
well
in
house
building
It
is
employed
by
shoemakers
and
saddlers
for
cutting
boards
and
is
well
suited
for
carving
purposes

BURIAL
OF
SIR
JOHN
MOORE
CHARLES
WOLFE
Not
a

was
heard
not
a
funeral
note
As
his
corpse
to
the
rampart
we
hurried
Not
a
soldier
discharged
his
farewell
shot
O
er
the
grave
where
our
hero
we
buried
We
buried
him
darkly
at
dead
of
night
The
sods
with
our
bayonets
turning
By
the
struggling
moonbeam
s
misty
light
And
the
lantern
dimly
burning
No
useless
coffin
enclosed
his
breast
Nor
in
sheet
nor
in
shroud
we
wound
him
But
he
lay
like
a
warrior
taking
his
rest
With
his
martial
cloak
around
him
Few
and
short
were
the
prayers
we
said
And
we
spoke
not
a
word
of
sorrow
But
we
steadfastly
gazed
on
the
face
that
was
dead
And
we
bitterly
thought
of
the
morrow
We
thought
as
we
hollowed
his
narrow
bed
And
smoothed
down
his
lonely
pillow
That
the
foe
and
the
stranger
would
tread
o
er
his

And
we
far
away
on
the
billow
Lightly
they
ll
talk
of
the
spirit
that
s
gone
And
o
er
his
cold
ashes
upbraid
him
But
little
he
ll
reck
if
they
let
him
sleep
on
In
the
grave
where
a
Briton
has
laid
him
But
half
of
our
heavy
task
was
done
When
the
clock
struck
the
hour
for
retiring
And
we
heard
the
distant
and
random
gun
That
the
foe
was
sullenly
firing
Slowly
and
sadly
we
laid
him
down
From
the
field
of
his
fame
fresh
and
gory
We
carved
not
a
line
and
we
raised
not
a
stone
But
we
left
him
alone
with
his
glory

We
buried

At

LXXVIII
THE
GOLDEN
TOUCH
NATHANIEL
HAWTHORNE
FIRST
READING
Illustration
Once
upon
a
time
there
lived
a
very
rich
man
and
a
king
besides
whose
name
was
Midas
and
he
had
a
little
daughter
whom
nobody
but
myself
ever
heard
of
and
whose
name
I
either
never
knew
or
have
entirely
forgotten
So
because
I
love
odd
names
for
little
girls
I
choose
to
call
her
Marygold
This
King
Midas
was
fonder
of
gold
than
of
any
thing
else
in
the
world
He
valued
his
royal
crown
chiefly
because
it
was
composed
of
that
precious
metal
If
he
loved
any
thing
better
or
half
so
well
it
was
the
one
little
maiden
who
played
so
merrily
around
her
father
s
footstool
But
the
more
Midas
loved
his
daughter
the
more
did
he
desire
and
seek
for
wealth
He
thought
foolish
man
that
the
best
thing
he
could
possibly
do
for
this
dear
child
would
be
to
bequeath
her
the
largest
pile
of
glistening
coin
that
had
ever
been
heaped
together
since
the
world
was
made
Thus
he
gave
all
his
thoughts
and
all
his
time
to
this
one
purpose
If
ever
he
happened
to
gaze
for
an
instant
at
the
gold
tinted
clouds
of
sunset
he
wished
that
they
were
real
gold
and
that
they
could
be
squeezed
safely
into
his
strong
box
When
little
Marygold
ran
to
meet
him
with
a
bunch
of
buttercups
and
dandelions
he
used
to
say
Pooh
pooh
child
If
these
flowers
were
as
golden
as
they
look
they
would
be
worth
the
plucking
At
length
as
people
always
grow
more
and
more
foolish
unless
they
take
care
to
grow
wiser
and
wiser
Midas
had
got
to
be
so
exceedingly
unreasonable
that
he
could
scarcely
bear
to
see
or
touch
any
object
that
was
not
gold
He
made
it
his
custom
therefore
to
pass
a
large
portion
of
every
day
in
a
dark
and
dreary
apartment
under
ground
at
the
basement
of
his
palace
It
was
here
that
he
kept
his
wealth
To
this
dismal
hole
for
it
was
little
better
than
a
dungeon
Midas
betook
himself
whenever
he
wanted
to
be
particularly
happy
Here
after
carefully
locking
the
door
he
would
take
a
bag
of
gold
coin
or
a
gold
cup
as
big
as
a
washbowl
or
a
heavy
golden
bar
or
a
peck
measure
of
gold
dust
and
bring
them
from
the
obscure
corners
of
the
room
into
the
one
bright
and
narrow
sunbeam
that
fell
from
the
dungeon
like
window
He
valued
the
sunbeam
for
no
other
reason
but
that
his
treasure
would
not
shine
without
its
help
And
then
would
he
reckon
over
the
coins
in
the
bag
toss
up
the
bar
and
catch
it
as
it
came
down
sift
the
gold
dust
through
his
fingers
look
at
the
funny
image
of
his
own
face
as
reflected
in
the
burnished
circumference
of
the
cup
and
whisper
to
himself
O
Midas
rich
King
Midas
what
a
happy
man
art
thou
Midas
was
enjoying
himself
in
his
treasure
room
one
day
as
usual
when
he
perceived
a
shadow
fall
over
the
heaps
of
gold
and
looking
up
he
beheld
the
figure
of
a
stranger
standing
in
the
bright
and
narrow
sunbeam
It
was
a
young
man
with
a
cheerful
and
ruddy
face
Whether
it
was
that
the
imagination
of
King
Midas
threw
a
yellow
tinge
over
every
thing
or
whatever
the
cause
might
be
he
could
not
help
fancying
that
the
smile
with
which
the
stranger
regarded
him
had
a
kind
of
golden
brightness
in
it
Certainly
there
was
now
a
brighter
gleam
upon
all
the
piled
up
treasures
than
before
Even
the
remotest
corners
had
their
share
of
it
and
were
lighted
up
when
the
stranger
smiled
as
with
tips
of
flame
and
sparkles
of
fire
As
Midas
knew
that
he
had
carefully
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
that
no
mortal
strength
could
possibly
break
into
his
treasure
room
he
of
course
concluded
that
his
visitor
must
be
something
more
than
mortal
Midas
had
met
such
beings
before
now
and
was
not
sorry
to
meet
one
of
them
again
The
stranger
s
aspect
indeed
was
so
good
humored
and
kindly
if
not
beneficent
that
it
would
have
been
unreasonable
to
suspect
him
of
intending
any
mischief
It
was
far
more
probable
that
he
came
to
do
Midas
a
favor
And
what
could
that
favor
be
unless
to
multiply
his
heaps
of
treasure
The
stranger
gazed
about
the
room
and
when
his
lustrous
smile
had
glistened
upon
all
the
golden
objects
that
were
there
he
turned
again
to
Midas
You
are
a
wealthy
man
friend
Midas
he
observed
I
doubt
whether
any
other
four
walls
on
earth
contain
so
much
gold
as
you
have
contrived
to
pile
up
in
this
room
I
have
done
pretty
well
pretty
well
answered
Midas
in
a
discontented
tone
But
after
all
it
is
but
a
trifle
when
you
consider
that
it
has
taken
me
my
whole
lifetime
to
get
it
together
If
one
could
live
a
thousand
years
he
might
have
time
to
grow
rich
What
exclaimed
the
stranger
Then
you
are
not
satisfied
Midas
shook
his
head
And
pray
what
would
satisfy
you
asked
the
stranger
Merely
for
the
curiosity
of
the
thing
I
should
be
glad
to
know
Midas
paused
and
meditated
He
felt
sure
that
this
stranger
with
such
a
golden
lustre
in
his
good
humored
smile
had
come
hither
with
both
the
power
and
the
purpose
of
gratifying
his
utmost
wishes
Now
therefore
was
the
fortunate
moment
when
he
had
but
to
speak
and
obtain
whatever
possible
or
seemingly
impossible
thing
it
might
come
into
his
head
to
ask
So
he
thought
and
thought
and
thought
and
heaped
up
one
golden
mountain
upon
another
in
his
imagination
without
being
able
to
imagine
them
big
enough
At
last
a
bright
idea
occurred
to
King
Midas
Raising
his
head
he
looked
the
lustrous
stranger
in
the
face
Well
Midas
observed
his
visitor
I
see
that
you
have
at
length
hit
upon
something
that
will
satisfy
you
Tell
me
your
wish
It
is
only
this
replied
Midas
I
am
weary
of
collecting
my
treasures
with
so
much
trouble
and
beholding
the
heap
so
diminutive
after
I
have
done
my
best
I
wish
every
thing
that
I
touch
to
be
changed
to
gold
The
stranger
s
smile
grew
so
bright
and
radiant
that
it
seemed
to
fill
the
room
like
an
outburst
of
the
sun
gleaming
into
a
shadowy
dell
where
the
yellow
autumnal
leaves
for
so
looked
the
lumps
and
particles
of
gold
lie
strewn
in
the
glow
of
light
The
Golden
Touch
exclaimed
he
You
certainly
deserve
credit
friend
Midas
for
striking
out
so
brilliant
a
fancy
But
are
you
quite
sure
that
this
will
satisfy
you
How
could
it
fail
said
Midas
And
will
you
never
regret
the
possession
of
it
What
could
induce
me
asked
Midas
I
ask
nothing
else
to
render
me
perfectly
happy
Be
it
as
you
wish
then
replied
the
stranger
waving
his
hand
in
token
of
farewell
To
morrow
at
sunrise
you
will
find
yourself
gifted
with
the
Golden
Touch
The
figure
of
the
stranger
then
became
exceedingly
bright
and
Midas
involuntarily
closed
his
eyes
On
opening
them
again
he
beheld
only
one
yellow
sunbeam
in
the
room
and
all
around
him
the
glistening
of
the
precious
metal
which
he
had
spent
his
life
in
hoarding
up

plant

a

inches
in

soil
The
seed
will
not
be
slow
to
germinate
first
swelling
and
then
bursting
its
outer
skin
a
vegetable
in
miniature
will
after
a
time
slowly
reveal
itself
to
the
observer
In
the
meantime
two
very
distinct
parts
make
their
appearance
one
yellowish
in
color
already
throwing
out
slender
fibrous
shoots
sinks
farther
into
the
soil
this
is
the
radicle
or
root
the
other
of
a
pale
greenish
color
takes
the
opposite
direction
ascends
to
the
surface
and
rises
above
the
ground
this
is
the
stem
This
root
and
stem
are
the
essential
organs
of
vegetation
without
which
when
we
have
excepted
certain
vegetables
of
an
inferior
order
plants
adorned
with

and

cannot
exist
How
vast
the
difference
between
the
verdant
top
of
a
tree
which
rises
graceful
and
elegant
into
mid
air
not
to
speak
of
the
flower
it
bears
and
the
coarse
tangled
mass
of
its
roots
and
rootlets
without
harmony
without
symmetry
These
organs
so
little
favored
in
their
appearance
have
however
very
important
functions
in
the
order
of
vegetable
action
The
chief
offices
of
the
root
are
two
in
the
first
place
it
attaches
the
plant
to
the
soil
holds
it
in
its
place
and
prevents
it
from
being
overwhelmed
by
the
elements
In
the
second
it
feeds
the
plant
by
absorbing
from
the
earth
the
sap
necessary
to
its
growth
How
is
this
done
The
root
branches
again
and
again
as
it
grows
throwing
out
numerous
smaller
branches
These
hollow
thread
like
rootlets
suck
up
from
the
soil
the
water
and
other
things
which
are
to
go
through
the
stem
or
trunk
and
the
branches
to
all
the
leaves
Here
these
are
made
into
the
perfect
sap
which
being
distributed
causes
the
plant
to
grow
to
blossom
and
to
bear
fruit
The
manner
in
which
roots
succeed
in
overcoming
obstacles
has
always
been
a
subject
of
surprise
to
the
observer
The
roots
of
trees
and
shrubs
when
cramped
or
hindered
in
their
progress
have
been
observed
to
exhibit
considerable
mechanical
force
throwing
down
walls
or
splitting
rocks
in
other
cases
clinging
together
in
bunches
or
spreading
out
their
fibres
over
a
prodigious
space
in
order
to
follow
the
course
of
a
rivulet
with
its
friendly
moisture
A
celebrated
botanist
of
the
last
century
relates
that
wishing
to
preserve
a
field
of
rich
soil
from
the
roots
of
a
row
of
elms
which
would
soon
have
exhausted
it
he
had
a
ditch
dug
between
the
field
and
the
trees
in
order
to
cut
the
roots
off
from
it
But
he
saw
with
surprise
that
those
roots
which
had
not
been
severed
in
the
operation
had
made
their
way
down
the
slope
so
as
to
avoid
meeting
the
light
had
passed
under
the
ditch
and
were
again
spreading
themselves
over
the
field
There
are
some
roots
which
are
developed
along
the
stem
itself
These
supplementary
organs
come
as
helps
to
the
roots
properly
so
called
and
replace
them
when
by
any
cause
they
have
been
destroyed
In
the
primrose
for
example
both
the
principal
and
the
secondary
roots
springing
from
it
perish
after
some
years
of
growth
but
the
supplementary
roots
springing
from
the
lower
part
of
the
stalk
prevent
the
plant
from
dying
In
the
tropical
forests
of
America
and
Asia
the
vanilla
whose
fruit
is
so
sought
after
for
its
sweet
aroma
twines
its
slender
stem
round
the
neighboring
trees
forming
an
elegant
flexible
and
aerial
garland
an
ornament
in
these
vast
solitudes
at
once
grateful
and
pleasing
The
underground
roots
of
the
vanilla
would
not
be
sufficient
for
the
nutriment
of
the
plant
and
the
rising
of
the
nourishing
sap
would
take
place
too
slowly
But
Nature
makes
up
for
this
inconvenience
by
the
air
roots
which
the
plant
throws
out
at
intervals
along
its
stem
Living
in
the
warm
and
humid
atmosphere
of
tropical
forests
the
stronger
shoots
soon
reach
the
ground
and
root
themselves
in
the
soil
Others
float
freely
in
the
atmosphere
inhaling
the
moisture
and
conveying
it
to
the
parent
stem
A
grand
tree
the
banyan
or
the
pagoda
fig
tree
adorns
the
landscape
of
India
and
presents
the
most
remarkable
development
of
aerial
roots
When
the
parent
stem
has
attained
the
height
of
some
fifty
or
sixty
feet
it
throws
out
side
branches
in
every
direction
and
each
branch
in
its
turn
throws
out
supplementary
roots
which
descend
perpendicularly
in
long
slender
shoots
till
they
reach
the
ground
When
they
have
rooted
themselves
in
the
soil
they
increase
rapidly
in
diameter
and
soon
form
around
the
parent
stem
thousands
of
columns
each
throwing
out
new
lateral
branches
and
new
roots
The
bended
twigs
take
root
and
daughters
grow
About
the
mother
tree
a
pillared
shade
The
natives
love
to
build
their
temples
in
the
intervals
left
between
these
roots
of
the
wild
fig
tree
A
famous
banyan
tree
on
the
Nerbuddah
is
said
by
Professor
Forbes
to
have
three
hundred
large
and
three
thousand
smaller
aerial
roots
it
is
capable
of
sheltering
thousands
of
men
and
thus
forms
one
of
the
marvels
of
the
vegetable
world
it
is
in
short
a
forest
within
a
forest
Roots
constantly
endeavor
to
bury
themselves
in
the
earth
They
seem
to
shun
the
light
of
day
and
this
tendency
is
to
be
seen
from
the
very
first
moment
when
the
root
shows
itself
in
the
seed
The
tendency
is
so
decided
and
appears
so
inherent
in
the
life
of
all
vegetables
that
if
we
reverse
a
germinating
seed
placing
it
with
the
root
upwards
the
root
and
the
stem
will
twist
round
of
themselves
the
stem
will
stretch
upward
and
the
root
will
bury
itself
in
the
ground

FIRST
READING
By
far
the
greater
number
of
plants
have
leaves
of
an
oval
shape
and
we
have
only
to
go
through
our
forests
and
gardens
to
see
them
on
every
hand
Exceedingly
varied
are
they
indeed
from
very
narrow
to
very
broad
oval
some
with
toothed
some
with
smooth
edges
and
some
even
deeply
notched
and
yet
to
such
an
extent
does
this
tendency
toward
a
rounded
form
prevail
that
there
seems
scarcely
a
plant
in
whose
leaves
a
trace
of
the
oval
may
not
be
found
The
apple
tree
gives
us
a
good
specimen
of
an
oval
leaf
and
an
immense
number
of
plants
have
leaves
resembling
it
in
shape
In
many
plants
the
leaves
are
almost
the
very
counterpart
of
those
of
the
apple
tree
in
some
they
are
narrower
and
in
others
still
narrower
till
we
come
to
very
slender
blades
like
those
of
the
grasses
and
then
beyond
still
to
the
needle
like
leaves
of
the
pines
On
the
other
hand
plants
are
to
be
found
with
leaves
broader
than
the
apple
leaf
and
so
on
rounder
and
rounder
until
we
come
to
such
plants
as
the
nasturtium
and
the
water
lily
whose
leaves
are
almost
as
round
as
circles
Illustration
LEAF
OF
APPLE
There
are
certainly
to
be
met
with
most
remarkable
departures
from
the
oval
shape
and
we
need
but
refer
to
such
leaves
as
those
of
the
buckwheat
to
find
that
roundness
seems
to
be
entirely
absent
Illustration
BUCKWHEAT
LEAF
This
style
of
leaf
of
which
there
are
many
variations
is
apparently
built
on
the
model
of
the
heart
shaped
leaf
of
which
the
morning
glory
affords
a
familiar
example
It
will
be
noted
however
that
instead
of
the
curvilinear
flow
of
outline
in
which
a
tendency
to
oval
roundness
is
plainly
visible
the
hastate
leaf
of
the
buckwheat
is
angular
throughout
Illustration
MORNING
GLORY
LEAF
Another
marked
characteristic
of
most
leaves
is
that
they
terminate
in
a
point
either
sharp
to
extreme
slenderness
or
blunt
to
broad
roundness
for
even
in
a
circular
leaf
there
is
one
point
which
is
its
extremity
and
to
which
the
margin
from
either
side
approaches
by
a
convexity
To
this
pointedness
of
leaves
the
exceptions
are
exceedingly
rare
A
plant
found
in
some
parts
of
our
own
country
the
magnificent
tulip
tree
presents
perhaps
the
most
extraordinary
of
all
Illustration
LEAF
OF
TULIP
TREE
Now
this
leaf
comes
out
of
a
bud
case
which
is
actually
oval
The
young
leaf
is
folded
double
inside
of
its
bud
case
and
besides
its
small
stalk
is
bent
over
so
as
to
bring
the
little
leaf
to
hold
its
end
downwards
We
can
see
this
curious
arrangement
very
well
just
after
the
bud
has
opened
and
the
young
leaf
has
come
out
However
it
soon
straightens
up
holds
its
little
head
aloft
and
looks
like
a
pretty
little
flag
After
this
it
spreads
apart
into
the
full
leaf
and
stands
up
like
a
banner
If
the
bud
be
held
up
to
the
light
the
young
leaf
can
be
seen
nicely
folded
up
inside
with
its
head
snugly
bent
down
There
is
nothing
prettier
or
more
curious
to
be
seen
in
the
woods
than
the
young
buds
of
the
tulip
trees
when
they
are
about
to
open
or
after
they
have
unfurled
their
little
flags
and
all
summer
long
even
from
earliest
spring
the
tulip
trees
are
continually
unfolding
their
buds

There
are
leaves
broader
above
than
below
and
some
instead
of
ending
in
a
point
have
a
notch
or
indentation
of
some
sort
Oak
trees
give
us
many
fine
and
varied
samples
of
notched
and
lobed
leaves
And
yet
the
leaf
of
the
chestnut
oak
is
not
at
all
notched
being
simply
ovate
pointed
and
toothed
The
leaves
of
the
bur
and
the
pin
oaks
on
the
contrary
are
lobed
and
notched
and
are
therefore
characteristic
oak
leaves
while
those
of
the
chestnut
oak
are
not
so
because
almost
all
oaks
have
leaves
more
or
less
scalloped
or
deeply
indented
Great
as
is
the
variety
in
the
shapes
of
oak
leaves
any
one
of
them
would
almost
surely
be
at
once
recognized
as
belonging
to
an
oak
tree
by
its
peculiar
scallopings
But
suppose
a
person
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
a
chestnut
oak
leaf
would
he
be
likely
to
recognize
such
a
leaf
simply
by
its
outline
There
is
still
another
oak
with
simple
leaves
and
they
are
not
even
toothed
but
entirely
smooth
all
around
the
edge
Looking
at
that
tree
which
is
called
the
willow
oak
scarcely
anyone
would
suppose
it
to
be
an
oak
unless
he
could
see
its
flowers
or
its
fruit
the
acorns

This
fact
brings
us
to
consider
a
very

point
in
the
study
of
a
plant
It
is
not
the
leaf
which
tells
us
what

it
is
the

and

Whatever
be

of

if
the

bears

it
is
an

If
a
tree
has
cherries
and

blossoms
it
is

It
is
true
that
in
many
families
of
plants
leaves
by
their
shape
alone
announce
at
once
the
kind
of
plant
to
which
they
belong
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
large
number
of
plants
that
cannot
be
known
by
their
leaves
but
only
by
their
flowers
and

It
is
by
flowers

that

are

these
are
in

the

SECOND
READING
Although
the
flower
and
its
fruit
tell
us
what
the
plant
is
and
leaves
do
not
with
any
certainty
there
is
yet
a
strong
similarity
as
well
in
texture
as
in
shape
in
the
leaves
of
most
of
the
plants
comprised
within
any
one
family
Especially
in
texture
is
this
marked
similarity
observable
and
perhaps
in
most
cases
the
peculiar
structure
of
the
leaf
aside
from
its
shape
is
indicative
of
the
order
to
which
the
plant
belongs
The
leaves
of
the
grasses
are
very
much
alike
so
are
the
leaves
of
the
sedges
and
though
it
is
true
also
that
in
some
instances
a
sedge
leaf
might
be
mistaken
for
a
grass
leaf
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
sedge
family
and
the
grass
family
have
some
points
of
similarity
Again
if
we
should
come
upon
a
plant
belonging
to
the
common
potato
or
nightshade
family
we
should
be
almost
sure
to
recognize
the
family
resemblance
at
the
very
first
glance
provided
we
were
already
familiar
with
a
number
of
plants
included
in
that
order
Yet
the
leaves
of
the
nightshade
family
vary
considerably
in
shape
and
it
is
therefore
decisively
the
texture
and
peculiar
appearance
of
the
leaves
that
announce
the
kinship
of
the
plant
And
thus
we
are
led
back
to
the
consideration
of
the
willow
oak
and
chestnut
oak
leaves
which
entirely
unlike
the
typical
oak
leaf
in
shape
are
yet
very
much
like
all
other
oak
leaves
in
texture
and
other
essential
structure
Illustration
LEAF
OF
THE
ROSE
Still
more
widely
divided
than
oak
leaves
are
such
as
are
called
pinnate
in
which
the
separated
parts
are
actually
distinct
leaflets
some
even
provided
with
stalks
Such
compound
leaves
may
be
seen
in
almost
every
garden
by
looking
at
a
rose
bush
In
the
cut
we
see
what
appears
to
be
five
distinct
leaves
attached
to
one
twig
but
the
fact
is
that
they
are
only
leaflets
and
together
with
the
stalk
which
bears
them
all
constitute
but
one
complete
leaf
Each
of
these
leaflets
has
a
short
stalk
connecting
it
with
the
main
stem
which
passes
between
the
pairs
and
has
an
odd
leaflet
at
the
end
A
rose
bush
may
have
leaves
of
seven
or
nine
leaflets
Among
our
forest
trees
hickory
walnut
butternut
locust
and
ash
have
pinnate
leaves
and
on
the
honey
locust
not
only
are
the
leaves
pinnate
but
on
the
same
tree
may
also
be
found
leaves
doubly
pinnate
and
even
tripinnate
Compound
leaves
may
be
seen
also
in
the
pea
vine
which
is
simply
pinnate
but
here
the
place
of
the
absent
terminal
leaflet
is
supplied
by
a
tendril
But
if
we
examine
a
bean
plant
we
do
find
an
odd
leaf
together
with
a
pair
of
leaflets
that
is
each
leaf
is
composed
of
three
leaflets
The
many
varieties
of
bean
plants
are
all
thus
three
leaved
Besides
the
woods
are
full
of
three
leaved
plants
belonging
to
other
kinds
of
the
bean
or
pulse
order
of
plants
In
addition
to
these
and
some
others
we
must
not
overlook
a
most
extraordinary
three
leaved
plant
plentiful
in
almost
every
forest
and
on
almost
every
stone
fence
in
the
country
only
too
well
known
by
persons
who
have
been
poisoned
by
it
and
yet
not
so
well
known
by
most
people
as
it
ought
to
be
for
it
is
often
confounded
with
a
plant
having
digitate
leaves

Here
side
by
side
the
forms
of
the
two
leaves
can
be
compared
On
the
right
is
the
digitate
leaf
of
the
beautiful
Virginia
creeper
entirely
harmless
on
the
left
is
the
pinnate
leaf
of
the
poison
vine
The
innocent
plant
is
five
leaved
the
noxious
plant
is
three
leaved
But
we
should
also
notice
particularly
that
the
arrangement
of
the
leaflets
is
quite
different
in
the
two
plants
In
the
poison
vine
we
see
a
pair
of
leaflets
and
a
terminal
odd
one
whereas
in
the
Virginia
creeper
there
is
no
pairing
of
leaflets
whatever
but
the
five
parts
radiate
from
a
centre
All
the
leaflets
come
out
together
from
one
point
at
the
tip
of
the
leaf
stalk
Plants
there
are
with
digitate
leaves
having
three
five
seven
nine
or
more
leaflets
Clover
has
digitate
leaves
of
three
leaflets
while
the
leaves
of
the
buck
eye
and
horse
chestnut
have
five
seven
and
nine
leaflets
The
pretty
little
wood
sorrel
plant
of
small
yellow
flowers
has
three
most
beautiful
inverted
heart
shaped
leaflets
radiating
from
the
tip
of
the
little
leaf
stalk

leaves
like
those
of
the
maple
we
see
the
main
veins
radiating
from
a
point
at
the
top
of
the
stalk
Such
leaves
are
therefore
much
like
the
digitate
kind
only
they
are
not
completely
divided
into
separate
leaflets

MAPLE

Sassafras
leaves
offer
forms
something
different
On
the
same
tree
may
be
seen
oval
two
lobed
and
three
lobed
leaves
Thus
on
one
and
the
same
plant
we
see
leaves
strikingly
different
in
form
yet
the
texture
the
color
and
the
veining
are
exactly
after
the
same
pattern
in
them
all
so
that
a
sassafras
leaf
whether
oval
or
cleft
can
at
once
be
easily
known
Recalling
to
mind
the
leaf
of
the
apple
buckwheat
morning
glory
oak
rose
Virginia
creeper
maple
and
sassafras
we
have
pretty
good
models
after
which
nearly
all
leaves
are
built
approximating
to
one
or
other
of
these
with
certain
variations
peculiar
to
the
species
Another
important
matter
regarding
the
leaves
of
plants
is
their
relative
position
on
the
stems
There
are
two
principal
and
very
marked
arrangements
of
leaves
Leaves
are
either
opposite
one
another
on
the
stem
or
they
are
alternate
or
not
opposite
There
are
whole
orders
of
plants
with
none
but
opposite
leaves
as
the
mint
family
In
other
orders
the
leaves
of
every
plant
are
alternate
And
again
in
some
orders
and
even
on
the
same
plants
are
found
both
opposite
and
alternate
leaves
as
in
the
composite
or
sunflower
family
and
a
single
wild
sunflower
plant
itself
has
opposite
leaves
below
and
alternate
leaves
above
Of
our
forest
trees
there
are
very
few
species
with
opposite
leaves
If
you
see
that
the
branches
and
leaves
of
a
tree
do
not
stand
one
opposite
another
on
the
stem
you
can
at
once
be
sure
that
it
is
not
an
ash
a
maple
or
a
buck
eye
because
all
these
trees
do
have
opposite
leaves
On
the
other
hand
there
are
many
trees
having
alternate
branches
and
leaves
such
as
the
oak
chestnut
elm
hickory
walnut
butternut
tulip
tree
alder
beech
birch
poplar
willow
mulberry
linden
locust
and
others

THE

OF

By

s
lonely
mountain
On
this
side
Jordan
s
wave
In
a
vale
in
the
land
of
Moab
There
lies
a
lonely
grave
And
no
man
knows
that
sepulchre
And
no
man
saw
it
e

For
the
angels
of
God
upturned
the
sod
And
laid
the
dead
man
there
That
was
the
grandest
funeral
That
ever
passed
on
earth
But
no
man
heard
the
trampling
Or
saw
the
train
go
forth
Noiselessly
as
the
daylight
Comes
when
the
night
is
done
And
the
crimson
streak
on
ocean

Grows
into
the
great

Noiselessly
as
the
spring

Her
crown
of
verdure
weaves
And
all
the
trees
on
all
the

Open
their
thousand
leaves
So
without
sound
of
music
Or
voice
of
them
that
wept
Silently
down
from
the

The
great
procession
swept
Perchance
the
bald
old
eagle
On
gray
Beth

height
Out
of
his
lonely
eyrie
Looked
on
the
wondrous

Perchance
the
lion
stalking
Still
shuns
that
hallowed
spot
For
beast
and

have
seen
and

That
which

But
when
the
warrior
dieth
His
comrades
in
the

With
arms
reversed
and

Follow
his
funeral
car
They
show
the
banners
taken
They
tell
his
battles
won
And
after
him
lead
his
masterless
steed
While
peals
the
minute
gun
Amid
the

of

We
lay
the

to

And
give
the

an
honored
place
With
costly
marble
dressed
In
the
great
minster
transept
Where
lights
like
glories
fall
And
the
sweet
choir
sings
and
the
organ
rings
Along
the
emblazoned
wall
This
was
the
bravest
warrior
That
ever
buckled
sword
This
the
most

That

And
never

Traced
with

On

half

As

And
had

honor
The

To
lie
in

while
angels
wait
With
stars
for

And
the
dark

like
tossing
plumes
Over
his

to

And
God

in
that
lonely
land
To
lay
him
in
the

In
that

without

LXXXVI
THE
GOLDEN
TOUCH
NATHANIEL
HAWTHORNE
SECOND
READING
Whether
Midas
slept
as
usual
that
night
the
story
does
not
say
But
when
the
earliest
sunbeam
shone
through
the
window
and
gilded
the
ceiling
over
his
head
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
bright
yellow
sunbeam
was
reflected
in
rather
a
singular
way
on
the
white
covering
of
the
bed
Looking
more
closely
what
was
his
astonishment
and
delight
when
he
found
that
this
linen
fabric
had
been
transmuted
to
what
seemed
a
woven
texture
of
the
purest
and
brightest
gold
The
Golden
Touch
had
come
to
him
with
the
first
sunbeam
Midas
started
up
in
a
kind
of
joyful
frenzy
and
ran
about
the
room
grasping
at
every
thing
that
happened
to
be
in
his
way
He
seized
one
of
the
bedposts
and
it
became
immediately
a
fluted
golden
pillar
He
pulled
aside
a
window
curtain
in
order
to
admit
a
clear
spectacle
of
the
wonders
which
he
was
performing
and
the
tassel
grew
heavy
in
his
hand
a
mass
of
gold
He
took
up
a
book
from
the
table
at
his
first
touch
it
assumed
the
appearance
of
such
a
splendidly
bound
and
gilt
edged
volume
as
one
often
meets
with
now
a
days
but
on
running
his
fingers
through
the
leaves
behold
it
was
a
bundle
of
thin
golden
plates
in
which
all
the
wisdom
of
the
book
had
grown
illegible
He
hurriedly
put
on
his
clothes
and
was
enraptured
to
see
himself
in
a
magnificent
suit
of
gold
cloth
which
retained
its
flexibility
and
softness
although
it
burdened
him
a
little
with
its
weight
He
drew
out
his
handkerchief
which
little
Marygold
had
hemmed
for
him
that
was
likewise
gold
with
the
dear
child
s
neat
and
pretty
stitches
running
all
along
the
border
in
gold
thread
Somehow
or
other
this
last
transformation
did
not
quite
please
King
Midas
He
would
rather
that
his
little
daughter
s
handiwork
should
have
remained
just
the
same
as
when
she
climbed
his
knee
and
put
it
into
his
hand
But
it
was
not
worth
while
to
vex
himself
about
a
trifle
Midas
took
his
spectacles
from
his
pocket
and
put
them
on
his
nose
in
order
that
he
might
see
more
distinctly
what
he
was
about
In
those
days
spectacles
for
common
people
had
not
been
invented
but
were
already
worn
by
kings
else
how
could
Midas
have
had
any
To
his
great
perplexity
however
excellent
as
the
glasses
were
he
discovered
that
he
could
not
possibly
see
through
them
But
this
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
for
on
taking
them
off
the
transparent
crystals
turned
out
to
be
plates
of
yellow
metal
and
of
course
were
worthless
as
spectacles
though
valuable
as
gold
It
struck
Midas
as
rather
inconvenient
that
with
all
his
wealth
he
could
never
again
be
rich
enough
to
own
a
pair
of
serviceable
spectacles
It
is
no
great
matter
nevertheless
said
he
to
himself
Very
philosophically
We
can
not
expect
any
great
good
without
its
being
accompanied
with
some
small
inconvenience
The
Golden
Touch
is
worth
the
sacrifice
of
a
pair
of
spectacles
at
least
if
not
of
one
s
very
eyesight
My
own
eyes
will
serve
for
ordinary
purposes
and
little
Marygold
will
soon
be
old
enough
to
read
to
me
Wise
King
Midas
was
so
exalted
by
his
good
fortune
that
the
palace
seemed
not
sufficiently
spacious
to
contain
him
He
therefore
went
down
stairs
and
smiled
on
observing
that
the
balustrade
of
the
staircase
became
a
bar
of
burnished
gold
as
his
hand
passed
over
it
in
his
descent
He
lifted
the
door
latch
it
was
brass
only
a
moment
ago
but
golden
when
his
fingers
quitted
it
and
emerged
into
the
garden
Here
as
it
happened
he
found
a
great
number
of
beautiful
roses
in
full
bloom
and
others
in
all
the
stages
of
lovely
bud
and
blossom
Very
delicious
was
their
fragrance
in
the
morning
breeze
Their
delicate
blush
was
one
of
the
fairest
sights
in
the
world
so
gentle
so
modest
and
so
full
of
sweet
soothing
did
these
roses
seem
to
be
But
Midas
knew
a
way
to
make
them
far
more
precious
according
to
his
way
of
thinking
than
roses
had
ever
been
before
So
he
took
great
pains
in
going
from
bush
to
bush
and
exercised
his
magic
touch
most
untiringly
until
every
individual
flower
and
bud
and
even
the
worms
at
the
heart
of
some
of
them
were
changed
to
gold
By
the
time
this
good
work
was
completed
King
Midas
was
summoned
to
breakfast
and
as
the
morning
air
had
given
him
an
excellent
appetite
he
made
haste
back
to
the
palace
What
was
usually
a
king
s
breakfast
in
the
days
of
Midas
I
really
do
not
know
and
can
not
stop
now
to
investigate
To
the
best
of
my
knowledge
however
on
this
particular
morning
the
breakfast
consisted
of
hot
cakes
some
nice
little
brook
trout
roasted
potatoes
fresh
boiled
eggs
and
coffee
for
King
Midas
himself
and
a
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
for
his
daughter
Marygold
Little
Marygold
had
not
yet
made
her
appearance
Her
father
ordered
her
to
be
called
and
seating
himself
at
table
awaited
the
child
s
coming
in
order
to
begin
his
own
breakfast
To
do
Midas
justice
he
really
loved
his
daughter
and
loved
her
so
much
the
more
this
morning
on
account
of
the
good
fortune
which
had
befallen
him
It
was
not
a
great
while
before
he
heard
her
coming
along
the
passage
crying
bitterly
This
circumstance
surprised
him
because
Marygold
was
one
of
the
most
cheerful
little
people
whom
you
would
see
in
a
summer
s
day
and
hardly
shed
a
tear
in
a
twelvemonth
When
Midas
heard
her
sobs
he
determined
to
put
little
Marygold
into
better
spirits
by
an
agreeable
surprise
so
leaning
across
the
table
he
touched
his
daughter
s
bowl
which
was
a
china
one
with
pretty
figures
all
around
it
and
changed
it
into
gleaming
gold
Meanwhile
Marygold
slowly
and
sadly
opened
the
door
and
showed
herself
with
her
apron
at
her
eyes
still
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
How
now
my
little
lady
cried
Midas
Pray
what
is
the
matter
with
you
this
bright
morning
Marygold
without
taking
the
apron
from
her
eyes
held
out
her
hand
in
which
was
one
of
the
roses
which
Midas
had
so
recently
changed
into
gold
Beautiful
exclaimed
her
father
And
what
is
there
in
this
magnificent
golden
rose
to
make
you
cry
Ah
dear
father
answered
the
child
between
her
sobs
it
is
not
beautiful
but
the
ugliest
flower
that
ever
grew
As
soon
as
I
was
dressed
I
ran
into
the
garden
to
gather
some
roses
for
you
because
I
know
you
like
them
and
like
them
the
better
when
gathered
by
your
little
daughter
But
oh
dear
dear
me
What
do
you
think
has
happened
Such
a
sad
thing
All
the
beautiful
roses
that
smelled
so
sweetly
and
had
so
many
lovely
blushes
are
blighted
and
spoilt
They
are
grown
quite
yellowy
as
you
see
this
one
and
have
no
longer
any
fragrance
What
can
have
been
the
matter
with
them
Pooh
my
dear
little
girl
pray
don
t
cry
about
it
said
Midas
who
was
ashamed
to
confess
that
he
himself
had
wrought
the
change
which
so
greatly
afflicted
her
Sit
down
and
eat
your
bread
and
milk
You
will
find
it
easy
enough
to
exchange
a
golden
rose
like
that
which
will
last
hundreds
of
years
for
an
ordinary
one
which
would
wither
in
a
day
I
don
t
care
for
such
roses
as
this
cried
Marygold
tossing
it
contemptuously
away
It
has
no
smell
and
the
hard
petals
prick
my
nose
The
child
now
sat
down
to
table
but
was
so
occupied
with
her
grief
for
the
blighted
roses
that
she
did
not
even
notice
the
wonderful
change
in
her
china
bowl
Perhaps
this
was
all
the
better
for
Marygold
was
accustomed
to
take
pleasure
in
looking
at
the
queer
figures
and
strange
trees
and
houses
that
were
painted
on
the
outside
of
the
bowl
and
those
ornaments
were
now
entirely
lost
in
the
yellow
hue
of
the
metal
Midas
meanwhile
had
poured
out
a
cup
of
coffee
and
as
a
matter
of
course
the
coffee
pot
whatever
metal
it
may
have
been
when
he
took
it
up
was
gold
when
he
set
it
down
He
thought
to
himself
that
it
was
rather
an
extravagant
style
of
splendor
in
a
king
of
his
simple
habits
to
breakfast
off
a
service
of
gold
and
began
to
be
puzzled
with
the
difficulty
of
keeping
his
treasures
safe
The
cupboard
and
the
kitchen
would
no
longer
be
a
secure
place
of
deposit
for
articles
so
valuable
as
golden
bowls
and
golden
coffee
pots
Amid
these
thoughts
he
lifted
a
spoonful
of
coffee
to
his
lips
and
sipping
it
was
astonished
to
perceive
that
the
instant
his
lips
touched
the
liquid
it
became
molten
gold
and
the
next
moment
hardened
into
a
lump
Ha
exclaimed
Midas
rather
aghast
What
is
the
matter
father
asked
little
Marygold
gazing
at
him
with
the
tears
still
standing
in
her
eyes
Nothing
child
nothing
said
Midas
Take
your
milk
before
it
gets
quite
cold
He
took
one
of
the
nice
little
trouts
on
his
plate
and
touched
its
tail
with
his
finger
To
his
horror
it
was
immediately
changed
from
a
brook
trout
into
a
gold
fish
and
looked
as
if
it
had
been
very
cunningly
made
by
the
nicest
goldsmith
in
the
world
Its
little
bones
were
now
golden
wires
its
fins
and
tail
were
thin
plates
of
gold
and
there
were
the
marks
of
the
fork
in
it
and
all
the
delicate
frothy
appearance
of
a
nicely
fried
fish
exactly
imitated
in
metal
I
don
t
quite
see
thought
he
to
himself
how
I
am
to
get
any
breakfast
He
took
one
of
the
smoking
hot
cakes
and
had
scarcely
broken
it
when
to
his
cruel
mortification
though
a
moment
before
it
had
been
of
the
whitest
wheat
it
assumed
the
yellow
hue
of
Indian
meal
Its
solidity
and
increased
weight
made
him
too
bitterly
sensible
that
it
was
gold
Almost
in
despair
he
helped
himself
to
a
boiled
egg
which
immediately
underwent
a
change
similar
to
that
of
the
trout
and
the
cake
Well
this
is
terrible
thought
he
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
looking
quite
enviously
at
little
Marygold
who
was
now
eating
her
bread
and
milk
with
great
satisfaction
Such
a
costly
breakfast
before
me
and
nothing
that
can
be
eaten
Hoping
that
by
dint
of
great
dispatch
he
might
avoid
what
he
now
felt
to
be
a
considerable
inconvenience
King
Midas
next
snatched
a
hot
potato
and
attempted
to
cram
it
into
his
mouth
and
swallow
it
in
a
hurry
But
the
Golden
Touch
was
too
nimble
for
him
He
found
his
mouth
full
not
of
mealy
potato
but
of
solid
metal
which
so
burnt
his
tongue
that
he
roared
aloud
and
jumping
up
from
the
table
began
to
dance
and
stamp
about
the
room
both
with
pain
and
affright
Father
dear
father
cried
little
Marygold
who
was
a
very
affectionate
child
pray
what
is
the
matter
Have
you
burnt
your
mouth
Ah
dear
child
groaned
Midas
dolefully
I
don
t
know
what
is
to
become
of
your
poor
father
Oh
many
a
shaft
at
random
sent
Finds
mark
the
archer
little
meant
And
many
a
word
at
random
spoken
May
soothe
or
wound
a
heart

LXXXVIII
THE
FLOWER
Why
comes
the
flower
upon
the
plant
That
fruit
may
come
And
why
the
fruit
That
it
may
hold
protect
and
cherish
the
seed
And
why
the
seed
That
the
plant
may
have
offspring
that
other
plants
may
grow
up
and
be
as
near
like
itself
as
one
living
thing
can
well
be
like
another
The
flower
is
the
beginning
of
the
seed
the
first
step
toward
reproduction
and
the
fruit
is
the
flower
completed
If
it
does
throw
aside
its
floral
ornaments
its
petals
or
other
adorning
or
useful
parts
of
its
blooming
period
it
still
retains
the
maturing
seed
and
ends
in
the
ripened
fruit
Look
inside
of
almost
any
flower
and
you
will
see
embosomed
in
its
petals
the
thread
like
organs
called
stamens
with
little
yellow
knobs
at
their
ends
Shake
them
if
they
are
ripe
they
will
give
up
the
fine
dust
or
pollen
so
light
that
the
breeze
will
blow
it
away
Some
flowers
have
few
stamens
some
have
many
and
of
the
latter
the
apple
and
cherry
blossoms
afford
examples
Most
of
the
different
grasses
have
three
stamens
to
each
of
their
little
flowers
For
example
a
head
of
timothy
grass
has
a
long
thick
bunch
of
flowers
crowded
together
at
the
top
of
the
slender
stem
Early
in
the
summer
about
June
you
may
see
the
little
stamens
peeping
out
all
around
three
of
them
together
and
their
little
golden
knobs
dangling
in
the
breeze
Some
plants
have
only
two
stamens
on
a
flower
and
there
is
a
water
plant
called
the
mare
s
tail
with
only
one
stamen
A
few
flowers
indeed
are
wholly
destitute
of
this
organ
Besides
the
stamens
there
are
also
in
most
flowers
other
threads
stems
or
knobs
somewhat
like
the
stamens
but
generally
of
a
different
color
These
pistils
as
they
are
called
have
their
place
in
the
centre
of
the
flower
whilst
the
stamens
stand
around
them
Unlike
the
stamens
the
pistils
have
no
pollen
but
it
is
on
the
latter
that
the
pollen
must
fall
in
order
that
the
plant
may
bear
seed
It
is
in
the
bottom
of
the
pistils
that
the
seeds
grow
but
there
will
be
no
seed
unless
the
dust
or
pollen
from
the
stamens
falls
on
the
pistils
Most
plants
bear
flowers
that
have
both
stamens
and
pistils
Such
flowers
are
called
perfect
flowers
But
there
are
also
plants
that
have
two
kinds
of
flowers
in
some
of
which
are
stamens
only
and
in
the
others
pistils
only
Again
there
are
plants
some
of
which
have
flowers
with
stamens
only
and
others
of
which
have
flowers
with
pistils
only
The
willow
trees
are
such
plants
Of
the
five
senses
flowers
address
themselves
most
feelingly
to
two
In
delighting
the
sense
of
smell
they
stand
pre
eminent
almost
alone
Does
true
fragrance
ever
come
from
anything
but
a
plant
and
are
not
flowers
especially
the
generous
dispensers
of
grateful
odors
And
to
the
eye
what
wealth
of
beauty
do
they
unfold
We
need
think
of
no
more
than
the
lily
the
pink
and
the
rose
Was
anything
ever
arrayed
like
one
of
these
When
we
look
upon
them
they
fill
the
heart
with
joy
We
smell
of
them
and
exclaim
that
their
fragrance
exceeds
even
their
beauty
Again
we
look
upon
them
and
now
we
aver
that
their
beauty
surpasses
their
perfume

tall
white
chimney
tops
There

I
wish

But

On

You

just

And

I

XC
THE
FRUIT
GUSTAVUS
FRANKENSTEIN
It
is
not
alone
the
delicious
grape
the
grateful
apple
the
luscious
pear
the
clustered
cherries
the
tart
currants
the
golden
orange
the
sweet
blackberries
the
refreshing
melon
the
blooming
peach
the
purple
plum
the
sun
fed
strawberries
or
whatever
other
products
of
the
plants
we
may
deem
good
to
eat
that
are
entitled
to
the
name
of
fruit
The
very
mention
the
very
thought
of
fruit
brings
to
our
minds
an
ever
welcome
idea
of
something
not
only
wholesome
and
pleasing
to
the
taste
but
at
the
same
time
beautiful
for
all
fertile
flowers
on
whatever
plant
they
may
grow
merge
eventually
into
fruit
That
fruit
may
not
be
edible
it
may
be
bitter
it
may
be
sour
it
may
be
as
dry
as
a
chip
or
it
may
even
be
poisonous
still
it
is
fruit
It
is
fruit
to
the
plant
if
not
to
us
The
seed
we
may
say
is
the
infant
offspring
of
the
plant
by
means
of
which
in
the
course
of
nature
it
perpetuates
its
kind
The
flower
is
the
first
step
in
the
formation
of
the
fruit
The
plant
opens
to
the
sunshine
a
charming
expression
of
form
and
color
in
the
budding
flower
Nursing
in
its
bosom
the
growing
germ
the
flower
usually
sheds
its
gay
attire
throws
off
its
petals
its
ribbons
and
its
tassels
and
in
a
sober
motherly
way
devotes
itself
to
the
one
great
task
of
cherishing
perfecting
and
guarding
the
seed
In
fact
the
flower
which
at
first
seemed
but
a
transport
of
joy
now
shorn
of
its
bridal
ornaments
has
become
the
substantial
fruit
That
fruit
is
the
guardian
of
the
seed
within
which
sleeps
the
infant
plant
and
according
to
the
needs
of
that
seed
will
the
fruit
be
fashioned
Are
the
seeds
to
be
carried
far
and
wide
ten
to
one
the
fruit
is
furnished
with
a
plume
a
sail
or
a
wing
by
which
to
be
wafted
through
the
air
or
with
hooks
to
cling
to
passing
animals
or
with
some
other
contrivance
to
effect
conveyance
Or
if
the
seed
inside
be
provided
with
a
sail
the
fruit
will
open
and
let
the
little
seed
go
forth
and
seek
its
fortune
by
itself
Endless
are
the
expedients
by
which
the
seed
and
the
fruit
seek
to
perpetuate
the
kind
of
plant
from
which
they
spring
We
may
look
at
the
well
known
fruit
head
of
the
dandelion
which
is
the
prettiest
little
airy
like
silken
ball
that
can
be
imagined
Doubtless
it
has
not
occurred
to
everybody
what
this
beautiful
sphere
so
common
in
the
meadows
and
by
the
road
sides
really
is
Previous
to
this
sphere
and
in
the
place
of
it
was
the
flower
the
well
known
yellow
dandelion
which
belongs
to
the
composite
family
Illustration
DANDELION
HEAD
The
dandelion
is
not
really
one
flower
but
a
circled
group
of
many
small
flowers
or
florets
These
are
surrounded
by
an
outer
circle
of
green
leaflets
which
bend
down
when
the
florets
have
changed
into
fruits
allowing
them
to
radiate
in
every
direction
from
the
core
in
the
centre
The
whole
ball
is
made
up
of
many
small
fruits
each
of
which
is
a
single
seed
enclosed
in
a
thin
cover
surmounted
by
an
elevated
circled
plume
Blow
on
this
lovely
little
sphere
and
away
will
fly
the
little
tufted
fruits
some
one
way
and
some
another
If
there
is
any
breeze
stirring
there
is
no
knowing
how
far
they
will
go
It
is
not
strange
then
that
dandelions
spring
up
almost
everywhere
See
what
a
vast
number
of
fruits
must
go
sailing
about
all
over
the
country
on
a
dry
midsummer
s
day
It
is
true
not
half
of
them
grow
up
into
plants
to
make
more
dandelions
but
a
great
many
of
them
do
In
the
same
way
the
beautiful
asters
of
our
woods
with
their
flowers
of
yellow
or
purplish
disks
and
lovely
rays
of
white
or
purple
as
large
as
roses
let
their
little
fruits
fly
away
from
their
heads
as
soon
as
ripe
and
dry
There
are
about
as
many
different
kinds
of
fruits
as
there
are
of
flowers
The
plants
of
the
bean
family
for
instance
have
fruits
like
the
bean
pods
These
pods
when
ripe
and
dry
split
open
at
the
two
edges
and
then
the
beans
or
seeds
drop
out
Do
you
know
the
pods
of
the
honey
locust
trees
large
broad
thin
and
sweet
Clover
too
belongs
to
the
bean
family
You
can
find
the
tiny
pods
in
the
dry
heads
of
clover
if
you
will
pick
out
the
little
withered
flowers
and
open
them
Some
fruits
have
a
kind
of
wings
Such
are
the
fruits
of
our
beautiful
maple
tree
and
very
pretty
are
these
maple
keys
as
they
are
called
when
they
hang
in
clusters
from
the
branches
and
dangle
among
the
leaves
At
the
end
where
they
are
joined
there
is
in
each
key
a
thick
hard
round
swelling
in
which
is
the
seed
When
the
fruit
is
ripe
and
dry
it
falls
off
and
we
may
often
see
the
pair
of
keys
flying
away
together
As
they
are
light
they
go
whirling
in
the
wind
sometimes
to
a
great
distance
The
fruit
of
the
ash
tree
looks
like
that
of
the
maple
and
also
hangs
in
bunches
but
each
fruit
is
a
single
key
These
are
but
a
few
of
the
many
kinds
of
fruits
to
be
found
on
plants
each
in
itself
a
curiosity
and
a
beauty
and
how
much
we
fairly
owe
to
them
is
scarcely
ever
in
our
thoughts
If
we
consider
but
wheat
alone
how
valuable
to
us
is
its
little
fruit
the
simple
grain
to
say
nothing
of
the
fruits
of
other
grasses
such
as
rice
rye
oats
and
the
large
and
generous
ears
of
Indian
corn
Nor
must
the
cotton
plant
be
forgotten
whose
fruit
does
not
indeed
feed
but
clothes
our

into
countless
uses
in
every
household

on
every
craft
that
sails
the
sea
and
inseparable
from
so
many
industries
on

and

The
fruit
of
the
cotton
plant
is
a
pod
which
bursting
open
reveals
a
mass
of
white
woolly
fibres
enveloping
and

I
thought
to
pass
away
before
and
yet
alive
I
am
And
in
the
fields
all
round
I
hear
the
bleating
of
the
lamb
How
sadly
I
remember
rose
the
morning
of
the
year
To
die
before
the
snowdrop
came
and
now
the
violet
s
here
O
sweet
is
the
new
violet
that
comes
beneath
the
skies
And
sweeter
is
the
young
lamb
s
voice
to
me
that
cannot
rise
And
sweet
is
all
the
land
about
and
all
the
flowers
that
blow
And
sweeter
far
is
death
than
life
to
me
that
long
to
go
It
seemed
so
hard
at
first
mother
to
leave
the
blessed
sun
And
now
it
seems
as
hard
to
stay
and
yet
His
will
be
done
But
still
I
think
it
can
t
be
long
before
I
find
release
And
that
good
man
the
clergyman
has
told
me
words
of
peace
O
blessings
on
his
kindly
voice
and
on
his
silver
hair
And
blessings
on
his
whole
life
long
until
he
meet
me
there
O
blessings
on
his
kindly
heart
and
on
his
silver
head
A
thousand
times
I
blessed
him
as
he
knelt
beside
my
bed
He
taught
me
all
the
mercy
for
he
showed
me
all
the
sin
Now
tho
my
lamp
was
lighted
late
there
s
One
will
let
me
in
Nor
would
I
now
be
well
mother
again
if
that
could
be
For
my
desire
is
but
to
pass
to
Him
that
died
for
me
I
did
not
hear
the
dog
howl
mother
or
the
death
watch
beat
There
came
a
sweeter
token
when
the
night
and
morning
meet
But
sit
beside
my
bed
mother
and
put
your
hand
in
mine
And
Effie
on
the
other
side
and
I
will
tell
the
sign
All
in
the
wild
March
morning
I
heard
the
angels
call
It
was
when
the
moon
was
setting
and
the
dark
was
over
all
The
trees
began
to
whisper
and
the
wind
began
to
roll
And
in
the
wild
March
morning
I
heard
them
call
my
soul
For
lying
broad
awake
I
thought
of
you
and
Effie
dear
I
saw
you
sitting
in
the
house
and
I
no
longer
here
With
all
my
strength
I
prayed
for
both
and
so
I
felt
resigned
And
up
the
valley
came
a
swell
of
music
on
the
wind
I
thought
that
it
was
fancy
and
I
listened
in
my
bed
And
then
did
something
speak
to
me
I
know
not
what
was
said
For
great
delight
and
shuddering
took
hold
of
all
my
mind
And
up
the
valley
came
again
the
music
on
the
wind
But
you
were
sleeping
and
I
said
It
s
not
for
them
it
s
mine
And
if
it
comes
three
times
I
thought
I
take
it
for
a
sign
And
once
again
it
came
and
close
beside
the
window
bars
Then
seemed
to
go
right
up
to
Heaven
and
die
among
the
stars
So
now
I
think
my
time
is
near
I
trust
it
is
I
know
The
blessed
music
went
that
way
my
soul
will
have
to
go
And
for
myself
indeed
I
care
not
if
I
go
to
day
But
Effie
you
must
comfort
her
when
I
am
past
away
And
say
to
Robin
a
kind
word
and
tell
him
not
to
fret
There
s
many
worthier
than
I
would
make
him
happy
yet
If
I
had
lived
I
cannot
tell
I
might
have
been
his
wife
But
all
these
things
have
ceased
to
be
with
my
desire
of
life
O
look
the
sun
begins
to
rise
the
heavens
are
in
a
glow
He
shines
upon
a
hundred
fields
and
all
of
them
I
know
And
there
I
move
no
longer
now
and
there
his
light
may
shine
Wild
flowers
in
the
valley
for
other
hands
than
mine
O
sweet
and
strange
it
seems
to
me
that
ere
this
day
is
done
The
voice
that
now
is
speaking
may
be
beyond
the
sun
For
ever
and
for
ever
with
those
just
souls
and
true
And
what
is
life
that
we
should
moan
why
make
we
such
ado
For
ever
and
forever
all
in
a
blessed
home
And
there
to
wait
a
little
while
till
you
and
Effie
come
To
lie
within
the
light
of
God
as
I
lie
upon
your
breast
And
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
XCII
THE
GOLDEN
TOUCH
NATHANIEL
HAWTHORNE
THIRD
READING
And
truly
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
pitiable
case
in
all
your
lives
Here
was
literally
the
richest
breakfast
that
could
be
set
before
a
king
and
its
very
richness
made
it
absolutely
good
for
nothing
The
poorest
laborer
sitting
down
to
his
crust
of
bread
and
cup
of
water
was
far
better
off
than
King
Midas
whose
delicate
food
was
really
worth
its
weight
in
gold
And
what
was
to
be
done
Already
at
breakfast
Midas
was
excessively
hungry
Would
he
be
less
so
by
dinner
time
And
how
ravenous
would
be
his
appetite
for
supper
which
must
undoubtedly
consist
of
the
same
sort
of
indigestible
dishes
as
those
now
before
him
How
many
days
think
you
would
he
survive
a
continuance
of
this
rich
fare
These
reflections
so
troubled
wise
King
Midas
that
he
began
to
doubt
whether
after
all
riches
are
the
one
desirable
thing
in
the
world
or
even
the
most
desirable
But
this
was
only
a
passing
thought
So
fascinated
was
Midas
with
the
glitter
of
the
yellow
metal
that
he
would
still
have
refused
to
give
up
the
Golden
Touch
for
so
paltry
a
consideration
as
a
breakfast
Just
imagine
what
a
price
for
one
meal
s
victuals
It
would
have
been
the
same
as
paying
millions
and
millions
of
money
for
some
fried
trout
an
egg
a
potato
a
hot
cake
and
a
cup
of
coffee
It
would
be
much
too
dear
thought
Midas
Nevertheless
so
great
was
his
hunger
and
the
perplexity
of
his
situation
that
he
again
groaned
aloud
and
very
grievously
too
Our
pretty
Marygold
could
endure
it
no
longer
She
sat
a
moment
gazing
at
her
father
and
trying
with
all
the
might
of
her
little
wits
to
find
out
what
was
the
matter
with
him
Then
with
a
sweet
and
sorrowful
impulse
to
comfort
him
she
started
from
her
chair
and
running
to
Midas
threw
her
arms
affectionately
about
his
knees
He
bent
down
and
kissed
her
He
felt
that
his
little
daughter
s
love
was
worth
a
thousand
times
more
than
he
had
gained
by
the
Golden
Touch
My
precious
precious
Marygold
cried
he
But
Marygold
made
no
answer
Alas
what
had
he
done
How
fatal
was
the
gift
which
the
stranger
had
bestowed
The
moment
the
lips
of
Midas
touched
Marygold
s
forehead
a
change
had
taken
place
Her
sweet
rosy
face
so
full
of
affection
as
it
had
been
assumed
a
glittering
yellow
color
with
yellow
tear
drops
congealing
on
her
cheeks
Her
beautiful
brown
ringlets
took
the
same
tint
Her
soft
and
tender
little
form
grew
hard
and
inflexible
within
her
father
s
encircling
arms
O
terrible
misfortune
The
victim
of
his
insatiable
desire
for
wealth
little
Marygold
was
a
human
child
no
longer
but
a
golden
statue
Yes
there
she
was
with
the
questioning
look
of
love
grief
and
pity
hardened
into
her
face
It
was
the
prettiest
and
most
woful
sight
that
ever
mortal
saw
All
the
features
and
tokens
of
Marygold
were
there
even
the
beloved
little
dimple
remained
in
her
golden
chin
But
the
more
perfect
was
the
resemblance
the
greater
was
the
father
s
agony
at
beholding
this
golden
image
which
was
all
that
was
left
him
of
a
daughter
It
had
been
a
favorite
phrase
of
Midas
whenever
he
felt
particularly
fond
of
the
child
to
say
that
she
was
worth
her
weight
in
gold
And
now
the
phrase
had
become
literally
true
And
now
at
last
when
it
was
too
late
he
felt
how
infinitely
a
warm
and
tender
heart
that
loved
him
exceeded
in
value
all
the
wealth
that
could
be
piled
up
betwixt
the
earth
and
sky
It
would
be
too
sad
a
story
if
I
were
to
tell
you
how
Midas
in
the
fulness
of
all
his
gratified
desires
began
to
wring
his
hands
and
bemoan
himself
and
how
he
could
neither
bear
to
look
at
Marygold
nor
yet
to
look
away
from
her
Except
when
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
image
he
could
not
possibly
believe
that
she
was
changed
to
gold
But
stealing
another
glance
there
was
the
precious
little
figure
with
a
yellow
tear
drop
on
its
yellow
cheek
and
a
look
so
piteous
and
tender
that
it
seemed
as
if
that
very
expression
must
needs
soften
the
gold
and
make
it
flesh
again
This
however
could
not
be
So
Midas
had
only
to
wring
his
hands
and
to
wish
that
he
were
the
poorest
man
in
the
wide
world
if
the
loss
of
all
his
wealth
might
bring
back
the
faintest
rose
color
to
his
dear
child
s
face
While
he
was
in
this
tumult
of
despair
he
suddenly
beheld
a
stranger
standing
near
the
door
Midas
bent
down
his
head
without
speaking
for
he
recognized
the
same
figure
which
had
appeared
to
him
the
day
before
in
the
treasure
room
and
had
bestowed
on
him
this
disastrous
power
of
the
Golden
Touch
The
stranger
s
countenance
still
wore
a
smile
which
seemed
to
shed
a
yellow
lustre
all
about
the
room
and
gleamed
on
little
Marygold
s
image
and
on
the
other
objects
that
had
been
transmuted
by
the
touch
of
Midas
Well
friend
Midas
said
the
stranger
pray
how
do
you
succeed
with
the
Golden
Touch
Midas
shook
his
head
I
am
very
miserable
said
he
Very
miserable
indeed
exclaimed
the
stranger
and
how
happens
that
Have
I
not
faithfully
kept
my
promise
with
you
Have
you
not
every
thing
that
your
heart
desired
Gold
is
not
every
thing
answered
Midas
And
I
have
lost
all
that
my
heart
really
cared
for
Ah
So
you
have
made
a
discovery
since
yesterday
observed
the
stranger
Let
us
see
then
Which
of
these
two
things
do
you
think
is
really
worth
the
most
the
gift
of
the
Golden
Touch
or
one
cup
of
clear
cold
water
O
blessed
water
exclaimed
Midas
It
will
never
moisten
my
parched
throat
again
The
Golden
Touch
continued
the
stranger
or
a
crust
of
bread
A
piece
of
bread
answered
Midas
is
worth
all
the
gold
on
earth
The
Golden
Touch
asked
the
stranger
or
your
own
little
Marygold
warm
soft
and
loving
as
she
was
an
hour
ago
O
my
child
my
dear
child
cried
poor
King
Midas
wringing
his
hands
I
would
not
have
given
that
one
small
dimple
in
her
chin
for
the
power
of
changing
this
whole
big
earth
into
a
solid
lump
of
gold
You
are
wiser
than
you
were
King
Midas
said
the
stranger
looking
seriously
at
him
Your
own
heart
I
perceive
has
not
been
entirely
changed
from
flesh
to
gold
Were
it
so
your
case
would
indeed
be
desperate
But
you
appear
to
be
still
capable
of
understanding
that
the
commonest
things
such
as
lie
within
everybody
s
grasp
are
more
valuable
than
the
riches
which
so
many
mortals
sigh
and
struggle
after
Tell
me
now
do
you
sincerely
desire
to
rid
yourself
of
this
Golden
Touch
It
is
hateful
to
me
replied
Midas
A
fly
settled
on
his
nose
but
immediately
fell
to
the
floor
for
it
too
had
become
gold
Midas
shuddered
Go
then
said
the
stranger
and
plunge
into
the
river
that
glides
past
the
bottom
of
your
garden
Take
likewise
a
vase
of
the
same
water
and
sprinkle
it
over
any
object
that
you
may
desire
to
change
back
again
from
gold
into
its
former
substance
If
you
do
this
in
earnestness
and
sincerity
it
may
possibly
repair
the
mischief
which
your
avarice
has
occasioned
King
Midas
bowed
low
and
when
he
lifted
his
head
the
lustrous
stranger
had
vanished
You
will
easily
believe
that
Midas
lost
no
time
in
snatching
up
a
great
earthen
pitcher
but
alas
me
it
was
no
longer
earthen
after
he
touched
it
and
in
hastening
to
the
river
side
As
he
ran
along
and
forced
his
way
through
the
shrubbery
it
was
positively
marvellous
to
see
how
the
foliage
turned
yellow
behind
him
as
if
the
autumn
had
been
there
and
nowhere
else
On
reaching
the
river
s
brink
he
plunged
headlong
in
without
waiting
so
much
as
to
pull
off
his
shoes
Poof
poof
poof
gasped
King
Midas
as
his
head
emerged
out
of
the
water
Well
this
is
really
a
refreshing
bath
and
I
think
it
must
have
quite
washed
away
the
Golden
Touch
And
now
for
filling
my
pitcher
As
he
dipped
the
pitcher
into
the
water
it
gladdened
his
very
heart
to
see
it
change
from
gold
into
the
same
good
honest
earthen
vessel
which
it
had
been
before
he
touched
it
He
was
conscious
also
of
a
change
within
himself
A
cold
hard
and
heavy
weight
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
his
bosom
No
doubt
his
heart
had
been
gradually
losing
its
human
substance
and
been
changing
into
insensible
metal
but
had
now
been
softened
back
again
into
flesh
Perceiving
a
violet
that
grew
on
the
bank
of
the
river
Midas
touched
it
with
his
finger
and
was
overjoyed
to
find
that
the
delicate
flower
retained
its
purple
hue
instead
of
undergoing
a
yellow
blight
The
curse
of
the
Golden
Touch
had
therefore
really
been
removed
from
him
King
Midas
hastened
back
to
the
palace
and
I
suppose
the
servants
knew
not
what
to
make
of
it
when
they
saw
their
royal
master
so
carefully
bringing
home
an
earthen
pitcher
of
water
But
that
water
which
was
to
undo
all
the
mischief
that
his
folly
had
wrought
was
more
precious
to
Midas
than
an
ocean
of
molten
gold
could
have
been
The
first
thing
he
did
as
you
need
hardly
be
told
was
to
sprinkle
it
by
handfuls
over
the
golden
figure
of
little
Marygold
No
sooner
did
it
fall
on
her
than
you
would
have
laughed
to
see
how
the
rosy
color
came
back
to
the
dear
child
s
cheek
and
how
astonished
she
was
to
find
herself
dripping
wet
and
her
father
still
throwing
more
water
over
her
Pray
do
not
dear
father
cried
she
See
how
you
have
wet
my
nice
frock
which
I
put
on
only
this
morning
Illustration
For
Marygold
did
not
know
that
she
had
been
a
little
golden
statue
nor
could
she
remember
any
thing
that
had
happened
since
the
moment
when
she
ran
with
outstretched
arms
to
comfort
poor
King
Midas
Her
father
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
tell
his
beloved
child
how
very
foolish
he
had
been
but
contented
himself
with
showing
how
much
wiser
he
had
now
grown
For
this
purpose
he
led
little
Marygold
into
the
garden
where
he
sprinkled
all
the
remainder
of
the
water
over
the
rose
bushes
and
with
such
good
effect
that
above
five
thousand
roses
recovered
their
beautiful
bloom
There
were
two
circumstances
however
which
as
long
as
he
lived
used
to
remind
King
Midas
of
the
Golden
Touch
One
was
that
the
sands
of
the
river
in
which
he
had
bathed
sparkled
like
gold
the
other
that
little
Marygold
s
hair
had
now
a
golden
tinge
which
he
had
never
observed
in
it
before
she
had
been
changed
by
the
effect
of
his
kiss
This
change
of
hue
was
really
an
improvement
and
made
Marygold
s
hair
richer
than
in
her
babyhood
When
King
Midas
had
grown
quite
an
old
man
and
used
to
take
Marygold
s
children
on
his
knee
he
was
fond
of
telling
them
this
marvellous
story
pretty
much
as
I
have
told
it
to
you
And
then
would
he
stroke
their
glossy
ringlets
and
tell
them
that
their
hair
likewise
had
a
rich
shade
of
gold
which
they
had
inherited
from
their
mother
And
to
tell
you
the
truth
my
precious
little
folks
said
King
Midas
ever
since
that
morning
I
have
hated
the
very
sight
of
all
other
gold
save
this
Life
we
ve
been
long
together
Through
pleasant
and
through
cloudy
weather
Tis
hard
to
part
when
friends
are
dear
Perhaps
twill
cost
a
sigh
a
tear
Then
steal
away
give
little
warning
Choose
thine
own
time
Say
not
Good
Night
but
in
some
brighter
clime
Bid
me
Good
Morning

JOHN
GILPIN
Showing
how
he
went
farther
than
he
intended
and
came
safe
home
again
WILLIAM
COWPER
Illustration
John
Gilpin
was
a
citizen
Of
credit
and
renown
A
train
band
captain
eke
was
he
Of
famous
London
town
John
Gilpin
s
spouse
said
to
her
dear
Though
wedded
we
have
been
These
thrice
ten
tedious
years
yet
we
No
holiday
have
seen
To
morrow
is
our
wedding
day
And
we
will
then
repair
Unto
the
Bell
at
Edmonton
All
in
a
chaise
and
pair
My
sister
and
my
sister
s
child
Myself
and
children
three
Will
fill
the
chaise
so
you
must
ride
On
horseback
after
we
He
soon
replied
I
do
admire
Of
womankind
but
one
And
you
are
she
my
dearest
dear
Therefore
it
shall
be
done
I
am
a
linen
draper
bold
As
all
the
world
doth
know
And
my
good
friend
the
calender
Will
lend
his
horse
to
go
Quoth
Mrs
Gilpin
That
s
well
said
And
for
that
wine
is
dear
We
will
be
furnished
with
our
own
Which
is
both
bright
and
clear
John
Gilpin
kissed
his
loving
wife
O
erjoyed
was
he
to
find
That
though
on
pleasure
she
was
bent
She
had
a
frugal
mind
The
morning
came
the
chaise
was
brought
But
yet
was
not
allowed
To
drive
up
to
the
door
lest
all
Should
say
that
she
was
proud
So
three
doors
off
the
chaise
was
stayed
Where
they
did
all
get
in
Six
precious
souls
and
all
agog
To
dash
through
thick
and
thin
Smack
went
the
whip
round
went
the
wheels
Were
never
folks
so
glad
The
stones
did
rattle
underneath
As
if
Cheapside
were
mad
John
Gilpin
at
his
horse
s
side
Seized
fast
the
flowing
mane
And
up
he
got
in
haste
to
ride
But
soon
came
down
again
For
saddle
tree
scarce
reached
had
he
His
journey
to
begin
When
turning
round
his
head
he
saw
Three
customers
come
in
So
down
he
came
for
loss
of
time
Although
it
grieved
him
sore
Yet
loss
of
pence
full
well
he
knew
Would
trouble
him
much
more
Twas
long
before
the
customers
Were
suited
to
their
mind
When
Betty
screaming
came
down
stairs
The
wine
is
left
behind
Good
lack
quoth
he
yet
bring
it
me
My
leathern
belt
likewise
In
which
I
bear
my
trusty
sword
When
I
do
exercise
Now
Mrs
Gilpin
careful
soul
Had
two
stone
bottles
found
To
hold
the
liquor
that
she
loved
And
keep
it
safe
and
sound
Each
bottle
had
a
curling
ear
Through
which
the
belt
he
drew
And
hung
a
bottle
on
each
side
To
make
his
balance
true
Then
over
all
that
he
might
be
Equipped
from
top
to
toe
His
long
red
cloak
well
brushed
and
neat
He
manfully
did
throw
Now
see
him
mounted
once
again
Upon
his
nimble
steed
Full
slowly
pacing
o
er
the
stones
With
caution
and
good
heed
But
finding
soon
a
smoother
road
Beneath
his
well
shod
feet
The
snorting
beast
began
to
trot
Which
galled
him
in
his
seat
So
Fair
and
softly
John
he
cried
But
John
he
cried
in
vain
That
trot
became
a
gallop
soon
In
spite
of
curb
and
rein
So
stooping
down
as
needs
he
must
Who
cannot
sit
upright
He
grasped
the
mane
with
both
his
hands
And
eke
with
all
his
might
His
horse
who
never
in
that
sort
Had
handled
been
before
What
thing
upon
his
back
had
got
Did
wonder
more
and
more
Away
went
Gilpin
neck
or
nought
Away
went
hat
and
wig
He
little
dreamt
when
he
set
out
Of
running
such
a
rig
The
wind
did
blow
the
cloak
did
fly
Like
streamer
long
and
gay
Till
loop
and
button
failing
both
At
last
it
flew
away
Then
might
all
people
well
discern
The
bottles
he
had
slung
A
bottle
swinging
at
each
side
As
hath
been
said
or
sung
The
dogs
did
bark
the
children
screamed
Up
flew
the
windows
all
And
every
soul
cried
out
Well
done
As
loud
as
he
could
bawl
Away
went
Gilpin
who
but
he
His
fame
soon
spread
around
He
carries
weight
he
rides
a
race
Tis
for
a
thousand
pound
And
still
as
fast
as
he
drew
near
Twas
wonderful
to
view
How
in
a
trice
the
turnpike
men
Their
gates
wide
open
threw
And
now
as
he
went
bowing
down
His
reeking
head
full
low
The
bottles
twain
behind
his
back
Were
shattered
at
a
blow
Down
ran
the
wine
into
the
road
Most
piteous
to
be
seen
Which
made
his
horse
s
flanks
to
smoke
As
they
had
basted
been
But
still
he
seemed
to
carry
weight
With
leathern
girdle
braced
For
all
might
see
the
bottle
necks
Still
dangling
at
his
waist
Thus
all
through
merry
Islington
These
gambols
did
he
play
Until
he
came
unto
the
Wash
Of
Edmonton
so
gay
And
there
he
threw
the
Wash
about
On
both
sides
of
the
way
Just
like
unto
a
trundling
mop
Or
a
wild
goose
at
play
At
Edmonton
his
loving
wife
From
the
balcony
espied
Her
tender
husband
wondering
much
To
see
how
he
did
ride
Stop
stop
John
Gilpin
Here
s
the
house
They
all
at
once
did
cry
The
dinner
waits
and
we
are
tired
Said
Gilpin
So
am
I
But
yet
his
horse
was
not
a
whit
Inclined
to
tarry
there
For
why
his
owner
had
a
house
Full
ten
miles
off
at
Ware
So
like
an
arrow
swift
he
flew
Shot
by
an
archer
strong
So
did
he
fly
which
brings
me
to
The
middle
of
my
song
Away
went
Gilpin
out
of
breath
And
sore
against
his
will
Till
at
his
friend
the
calender
s
His
horse
at
last
stood
still
The
calender
amazed
to
see
His
neighbor
in
such
trim
Laid
down
his
pipe
flew
to
the
gate
And
thus
accosted
him
What
news
what
news
your
tidings
tell
Tell
me
you
must
and
shall
Say
why
bareheaded
you
are
come
Or
why
you
come
at
all
Now
Gilpin
had
a
pleasant
wit
And
loved
a
timely
joke
And
thus
unto
the
calender
In
merry
guise
he
spoke
I
came
because
your
horse
would
come
And
if
I
well
forebode
My
hat
and
wig
will
soon
be
here
They
are
upon
the
road
The
calender
right
glad
to
find
His
friend
in
merry
pin
Returned
him
not
a
single
word
But
to
the
house
went
in
Whence
straight
he
came
with
hat
and
wig
A
wig
that
flowed
behind
A
hat
not
much
the
worse
for
wear
Each
comely
in
its
kind
He
held
them
up
and
in
his
turn
Thus
showed
his
ready
wit
My
head
is
twice
as
big
as
yours
They
therefore
needs
must
fit
But
let
me
scrape
the
dirt
away
That
hangs
upon
your
face
And
stop
and
eat
for
well
you
may
Be
in
a
hungry
case
Said
John
It
is
my
wedding
day
And
all
the
world
would
stare
If
wife
should
dine
at
Edmonton
And
I
should
dine
at
Ware
So
turning
to
his
horse
he
said
I
am
in
haste
to
dine
Twas
for
your
pleasure
you
came
here
You
shall
go
back
for
mine
Ah
luckless
speech
and
bootless
boast
For
which
he
paid
full
dear
For
while
he
spake
a
braying
ass
Did
sing
most
loud
and
clear
Whereat
his
horse
did
snort
as
he
Had
heard
a
lion
roar
And
galloped
off
with
all
his
might
As
he
had
done
before
Away
went
Gilpin
and
away
Went
Gilpin
s
hat
and
wig
He
lost
them
sooner
than
at
first
For
why
they
were
too
big
Now
mistress
Gilpin
when
she
saw
Her
husband
posting
down
Into
the
country
far
away
She
pulled
out
half
a
crown
And
thus
unto
the
youth
she
said
That
drove
them
to
the
Bell
This
shall
be
yours
when
you
bring
back
My
husband
safe
and
well
The
youth
did
ride
and
soon
did
meet
John
coming
back
amain
Whom
in
a
trice
he
tried
to
stop
By
catching
at
his
rein
But
not
performing
what
he
meant
And
gladly
would
have
done
The
frighted
steed
he
frighted
more
And
made
him
faster
run
Away
went
Gilpin
and
away
Went
postboy
at
his
heels
The
postboy
s
horse
right
glad
to
miss
The
lumbering
of
the
wheels
Six
gentlemen
upon
the
road
Thus
seeing
Gilpin
fly
With
postboy
scampering
in
the
rear
They
raised
the
hue
and
cry
Stop
thief
stop
thief
a
highwayman
Not
one
of
them
was
mute
And
all
and
each
that
passed
that
way
Did
join
in
the
pursuit
And
now
the
turnpike
gates
again
Flew
open
in
short
space
The
toll
men
thinking
as
before
That
Gilpin
rode
a
race
And
so
he
did
and
won
it
too
For
he
got
first
to
town
Nor
stopped
till
where
he
had
got
up
He
did
again
get
down
Now
let
us
sing
long
live
the
king
And
Gilpin
long
live
he
And
when
he
next
doth
ride
abroad
May
I
be
there
to
see
